However, challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of scalable EHR-based stratification analysis. Here we present an unsupervised framework based on deep learning to process heterogeneous EHRs and derive patient representations that can efficiently and effectively enable patient stratification at scale. We considered EHRs of 1,608,741 patients from a diverse hospital cohort comprising a total of 57,464 clinical concepts. We introduce a representation learning model based on word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders (i.e., ConvAE) to transform patient trajectories into low-dimensional latent vectors. We evaluated these representations as broadly enabling patient stratification by applying hierarchical clustering to different multi-disease and disease-specific patient cohorts. ConvAE significantly outperformed several baselines in a clustering task to identify patients with different complex conditions, with 2.61 entropy and 0.31 purity average scores. When applied to stratify patients within a certain condition, ConvAE led to various clinically relevant subtypes for different disorders, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease, largely related to comorbidities, disease progression, and symptom severity. With these results, we demonstrate that ConvAE can generate patient representations that lead to clinically meaningful insights. This scalable framework can help better understand varying etiologies in heterogeneous sub-populations and unlock patterns for EHR-based research in the realm of personalized medicine. © 2020, The Author(s).",,

The absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person.

Evidently, it should be clearly discriminated between the standardised “normal” body weight and individually optimal weight. To this end, the basic principle of personalised medicine “one size does not fit all” has to be applied. Contextually, “normal” but e.g. borderline body mass index might be optimal for one person but apparently suboptimal for another one strongly depending on the individual genetic predisposition, geographic origin, cultural and nutritional habits and relevant lifestyle parameters—all included into comprehensive individual patient profile. Even if only slightly deviant, both overweight and underweight are acknowledged risk factors for a shifted metabolism which, if being not optimised, may strongly contribute to the development and progression of severe pathologies. Development of innovative screening programmes is essential to promote population health by application of health risks assessment, individualised patient profiling and multi-parametric analysis, further used for cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The following healthcare areas are considered to be potentially strongly benefiting from the above proposed measures: suboptimal health conditions, sports medicine, stress overload and associated complications, planned pregnancies, periodontal health and dentistry, sleep medicine, eye health and disorders, inflammatory disorders, healing and pain management, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, cancers, psychiatric and neurologic disorders, stroke of known and unknown aetiology, improved individual and population outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. In a long-term way, a significantly improved healthcare economy is one of benefits of the proposed paradigm shift from reactive to Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (PPPM/3PM).

The appropriate utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methodologies can yield novel understandings of CVDs, enabling improved personalized treatments through predictive analysis and deep phenotyping. In this study, we proposed and employed a novel approach combining traditional statistics and a nexus of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to identify significant biomarkers for our predictive engine by analyzing the complete transcriptome of CVD patients. After robust gene expression data pre-processing, we utilized three statistical tests (Pearson correlation, Chi-square test, and ANOVA) to assess the differences in transcriptomic expression and clinical characteristics between healthy individuals and CVD patients. Next, the recursive feature elimination classifier assigned rankings to transcriptomic features based on their relation to the case–control variable. The top ten percent of commonly observed significant biomarkers were evaluated using four unique ML classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Xtreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors). After optimizing hyperparameters, the ensembled models, which were implemented using a soft voting classifier, accurately differentiated between patients and healthy individuals. We have uncovered 18 transcriptomic biomarkers that are highly significant in the CVD population that were used to predict disease with up to 96% accuracy. Additionally, we cross-validated our results with clinical records collected from patients in our cohort. The identified biomarkers served as potential indicators for early detection of CVDs. With its successful implementation, our newly developed predictive engine provides a valuable framework for identifying patients with CVDs based on their biomarker profiles. © 2024, The Author(s).",,

To date, single biomarkers have failed to markedly improve the estimation of CV risk. Using novel technology, simultaneous assessment of large numbers of biomarkers may hold promise to improve prediction. In the present study, we compared a protein-based risk model with a model using traditional risk factors in predicting CV events in the primary prevention setting of the European Prospective Investigation (EPIC)-Norfolk study, followed by validation in the Progressione della Lesione Intimale Carotidea (PLIC) cohort. Methods and results: Using the proximity extension assay, 368 proteins were measured in a nested case-control sample of 822 individuals from the EPIC-Norfolk prospective cohort study and 702 individuals from the PLIC cohort. Using tree-based ensemble and boosting methods, we constructed a protein-based prediction model, an optimized clinical risk model, and a model combining both. In the derivation cohort (EPIC-Norfolk), we defined a panel of 50 proteins, which outperformed the clinical risk model in the prediction of myocardial infarction [area under the curve (AUC) 0.754 vs. 0.730; P < 0.001] during a median follow-up of 20 years. The clinically more relevant prediction of events occurring within 3 years showed an AUC of 0.732 using the clinical risk model and an AUC of 0.803 for the protein model (P < 0.001). The predictive value of the protein panel was confirmed to be superior to the clinical risk model in the validation cohort (AUC 0.705 vs. 0.609; P < 0.001). Conclusion: In a primary prevention setting, a proteome-based model outperforms a model comprising clinical risk factors in predicting the risk of CV events. Validation in a large prospective primary prevention cohort is required to address the value for future clinical implementation in CV prevention.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This has deeply affected healthcare costs, since the growth of an aging population is correlated to the increasing burden of chronic diseases. This represents the interesting challenge of how to manage patients with chronic diseases in order to improve health care budgets. Effective primary prevention could represent a promising route. To this end, precision, together with personalized medicine, are useful instruments in order to investigate pathological processes before the appearance of clinical symptoms and to guide physicians to choose a targeted therapy to manage the patient. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases represent suitable models for taking full advantage of precision medicine technologies applied to all stages of disease development. The availability of high technology incorporating artificial intelligence and advancement progress made in the field of biomedical research have been substantial to understand how genes, epigenetic modifications, aging, nutrition, drugs, microbiome and other environmental factors can impact health and chronic disorders. The aim of the present review is to address how precision and personalized medicine can bring greater clarity to the clinical and biological complexity of these types of disorders associated with high mortality, involving tremendous health care costs, by describing in detail the methods that can be applied. This might offer precious tools for preventive strategies and possible clues on the evolution of the disease and could help in predicting morbidity, mortality and detecting chronic disease indicators much earlier in the disease course. This, of course, will have a major effect on both improving the quality of care and quality of life of the patients and reducing time efforts and healthcare costs. © 2020 by the authors.

We investigated stroke risks in a very large prospective cohort of patients with multimorbidity, using two common clinical rules, a clinical multimorbid index and a machine-learning (ML) approach, accounting for the complex relationships among variables, including the dynamic nature of changing risk factors. Methods  We studied a prospective U.S. cohort of 3,435,224 patients from medical databases in a 2-year investigation. Stroke outcomes were examined in relationship to diverse multimorbid conditions, demographic variables, and other inputs, with ML accounting for the dynamic nature of changing multimorbidity risk factors, two clinical risk scores, and a clinical multimorbid index. Results  Common clinical risk scores had moderate and comparable c indices with stroke outcomes in the training and external validation samples (validation-CHADS 2: c index 0.812, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.808-0.815; CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc: c index 0.809, 95% CI 0.805-0.812). A clinical multimorbid index had higher discriminant validity values for both the training/external validation samples (validation: c index 0.850, 95% CI 0.847-0.853). The ML-based algorithms yielded the highest discriminant validity values for the gradient boosting/neural network logistic regression formulations with no significant differences among the ML approaches (validation for logistic regression: c index 0.866, 95% CI 0.856-0.876). Calibration of the ML-based formulation was satisfactory across a wide range of predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that clinical utility for the ML-based formulation was better than that for the two current clinical rules and the newly developed multimorbid tool. Also, ML models and clinical stroke risk scores were more clinically useful than the treat all strategy. Conclusion  Complex relationships of various comorbidities uncovered using a ML approach for diverse (and dynamic) multimorbidity changes have major consequences for stroke risk prediction. This approach may facilitate automated approaches for dynamic risk stratification in the significant presence of multimorbidity, helping in the decision-making process for risk assessment and integrated/holistic management. © 2021.

The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate, and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signalling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need for combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine. © The Author(s) 2019.

The goal of this paper is to examine the promise of precision psychiatry to use information about a depressed person’s own pan-omics, environmental, and lifestyle data, or to tailor preventative measures and medical treatments to endophenotype subgroups of depressed patients in order to achieve the best clinical outcome for each individual. Three steps are emerging in precision medicine: (1) the optimization and refining of classical models and constructing digital twins; (2) the use of precision medicine to construct endophenotype classes and pathway phenotypes, and (3) constructing a digital self of each patient. The root cause of why precision psychiatry cannot develop into true sciences is that there is no correct (cross-validated and reliable) model of clinical depression as a serious medical disorder discriminating it from a normal emotional distress response including sadness, grief and demoralization. Here, we explain how we used (un)supervised machine learning such as partial least squares path analysis, SIMCA and factor analysis to construct (a) a new precision depression model; (b) a new endophenotype class, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), which is a nosological class defined by severe symptoms and neuro-oxidative toxicity; and a new pathway phenotype, namely the reoccurrence of illness (ROI) index, which is a latent vector extracted from staging characteristics (number of depression and manic episodes and suicide attempts), and (c) an ideocratic profile with personalized scores based on all MDMD features. © 2022 by the author.

Machine learning (ML) explores datasets to develop algorithms that do not assume linear relationships between variables and outcomes and that may account for higher order interactions to make individualized outcome predictions. To evaluate the performance of machine learning models compared to traditional risk stratification methods for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that are treated with antithrombotic therapy. Data on 24,178 ACS patients were pooled from four randomized controlled trials. The super learner ensemble algorithm selected weights for 23 machine learning models and was compared to traditional models. The efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The safety endpoint was a composite of TIMI major and minor bleeding or bleeding requiring medical attention. For the MACE outcome, the super learner model produced a higher c-statistic (0.734) than logistic regression (0.714), the TIMI risk score (0.489), and a new cardiovascular risk score developed in the dataset (0.644). For the bleeding outcome, the super learner demonstrated a similar c-statistic as the logistic regression model (0.670 vs. 0.671). The machine learning risk estimates were highly calibrated with observed efficacy and bleeding outcomes (Hosmer–Lemeshow p value = 0.692 and 0.970, respectively). The super learner algorithm was highly calibrated on both efficacy and safety outcomes and produced the highest c-statistic for prediction of MACE compared to traditional risk stratification methods. This analysis demonstrates a contemporary application of machine learning to guide patient-level antithrombotic therapy treatment decisions.

To this purpose, we propose a “digital twin” of patients modeling the human body as a whole and providing a panoramic view over individuals' conditions. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and integrates mathematical modeling in order to provide a panoramic view over current and future pathophysiological conditions. Our modular architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNN) forecasting clinically relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability. Results: We tested our digital twin model on two simulated clinical case studies combining information at organ, tissue, and cellular level. We provided a panoramic overview over current and future patient's conditions by monitoring and forecasting clinically relevant endpoints representing the evolution of patient's vital parameters using the GNN model. We showed how to use the GAN to generate multi-tissue expression data for blood and lung to find associations between cytokines conditioned on the expression of genes in the renin–angiotensin pathway. Our approach was to detect inflammatory cytokines, which are known to have effects on blood pressure and have previously been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., CXCR6, XCL1, and others). Significance: The graph representation of a computational patient has potential to solve important technological challenges in integrating multiscale computational modeling with AI. We believe that this work represents a step forward toward next-generation devices for precision and predictive medicine. © Copyright © 2021 Barbiero, Viñas Torné and Lió.",,

However, they do not present a framework that considers personalized patient-specific characteristics. Using the electronic health records of 21,460 patients, we created data-driven models for personalized CAD management that significantly improve health outcomes relative to the standard of care. We develop binary classifiers to detect whether a patient will experience an adverse event due to CAD within a 10-year time frame. Combining the patients’ medical history and clinical examination results, we achieve 81.5% AUC. For each treatment, we also create a series of regression models that are based on different supervised machine learning algorithms. We are able to estimate with average R2 = 0.801 the outcome of interest; the time from diagnosis to a potential adverse event (TAE). Leveraging combinations of these models, we present ML4CAD, a novel personalized prescriptive algorithm. Considering the recommendations of multiple predictive models at once, the goal of ML4CAD is to identify for every patient the therapy with the best expected TAE using a voting mechanism. We evaluate its performance by measuring the prescription effectiveness and robustness under alternative ground truths. We show that our methodology improves the expected TAE upon the current baseline by 24.11%, increasing it from 4.56 to 5.66 years. The algorithm performs particularly well for the male (24.3% improvement) and Hispanic (58.41% improvement) subpopulations. Finally, we create an interactive interface, providing physicians with an intuitive, accurate, readily implementable, and effective tool. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,

Recent data show a more complex situation, with mortality rates for overall cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke, decelerating, whereas those for heart failure are increasing. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Bethesda Conference, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association cosponsored the ""Bending the Curve in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Bethesda + 40"" symposium. The objective was to examine the immediate and long-term outcomes of the 1978 conference and understand the current environment. Symposium themes included trends and future projections in cardiovascular disease (in the United States and internationally), the evolving obesity and diabetes epidemics, and harnessing emerging and innovative opportunities to preserve and promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular disease. In addition, participant-led discussion explored the challenges and barriers in promoting cardiovascular health across the lifespan and established a potential framework for observational research and interventions that would begin in early childhood (or ideally in utero).

We aimed to evaluate the application of machine learning to clinical trials of patients without and with type 2 diabetes to define the personalised cardiovascular benefit of intensive control of systolic blood pressure. Methods: In SPRINT, a trial of intensive (systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg) versus standard (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure control in patients without type 2 diabetes, we defined a phenotypic representation of the study population using 59 baseline variables. We extracted personalised treatment effect estimates for the primary outcome, time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and acute decompensated heart failure), through iterative Cox regression analyses providing average hazard ratio (HR) estimates weighted for the phenotypic distance of each participant from the index patient of each iteration. Next, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (known as XGBoost) to predict the personalised effect of intensive systolic blood pressure control using features most consistently linked to increased personalised benefit, before evaluating its performance in the ACCORD BP trial of patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to receive intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control. We stratified patients based on their predicted treatment effect, and key demographic groups (age, sex, cardiovascular disease, and smoking). We assessed the presence of heterogeneity with an interaction test, and assessed the performance of the algorithm in a simulation analysis of SPRINT in the presence or absence of an artificially introduced heterogeneous treatment effect. Findings: From SPRINT, we included all 9361 study participants (mean age 67·9 years [SD 9·4], 3332 [35·6%] female) who underwent randomisation to either intensive (n=4678) or standard (n=4683) treatment. The median individualised HR for MACE was 0·63 (IQR 0·53–0·78). An eight-feature tool built for this analysis to predict personalised benefit in SPRINT was externally tested in ACCORD BP (4733 participants (mean age 62·7 years [SD 6·7], 2258 [47·7%] female), wherein it successfully identified individuals with differential benefit from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control (adjusted HR for MACE of 0·70 [95% CI 0·55–0·90] in individuals with above-median MACE benefit versus 1·05 [95% CI 0·84–1·32] for below-median predicted benefit; pinteraction=0·0184). Subgroup analysis based on age (<65 years: HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·71–1·12]; ≥65 years: 0·85 [0·67–1·09]), sex (male: 0·89 [0·72–1·10]; female: 0·85 [0·65–1·10]), established cardiovascular disease (no: 0·89 [0·70–1·14]; yes: 0·84 [0·67–1·06]), or active smoking (no: 0·85 [0·71–1·02]; yes: 1·01 [0·64–1·60]) did not identify groups with heterogeneity of treatment effect. In a simulation analysis of SPRINT, the proposed algorithm detected groups with heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence, but not absence, of simulated subgroup differences. Interpretation: By use of machine learning to define an individual's personalised benefit through phenotypic representations of clinical trials, we created a practical tool for individualising the selection of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control in patients without and with type 2 diabetes.

However, both novel risk factors and their interplay influencing stroke incidence are difficult to reveal using traditional additive models. The goal of this study was to improve upon the established Revised Framingham Stroke Risk Score and design an interactive Non-Linear Stroke Risk Score. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, our work aimed at increasing the accuracy of event prediction and uncovering new relationships in an interpretable fashion. A two-phase approach was used to create our stroke risk prediction score. First, clinical examinations of the Framingham offspring cohort were utilized as the training dataset for the predictive model. Optimal Classification Trees were used to develop a tree-based model to predict 10-year risk of stroke. Unlike classical methods, this algorithm adaptively changes the splits on the independent variables, introducing non-linear interactions among them. Second, the model was validated with a multi-ethnicity cohort from the Boston Medical Center. Our stroke risk score suggests a key dichotomy between patients with history of cardiovascular disease and the rest of the population. While it agrees with known findings, it also identified 23 unique stroke risk profiles and highlighted new non-linear relationships; such as the role of T-wave abnormality on electrocardiography and hematocrit levels in a patient’s risk profile. Our results suggested that the non-linear approach significantly improves upon the baseline in the c-statistic (training 87.43% (CI 0.85–0.90) vs. 73.74% (CI 0.70–0.76); validation 75.29% (CI 0.74–0.76) vs 65.93% (CI 0.64–0.67), even in multi-ethnicity populations. The clinical implications of the new risk score include prioritization of risk factor modification and personalized care at the patient level with improved targeting of interventions for stroke prevention. © 2020 Orfanoudaki et al.

Technological improvements in the field of medical imaging, in particular, in cardiac computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance protocols, laid the development of radiogenomics. Radiogenomics aims to integrate a huge number of imaging features and molecular profiles to identify optimal radiomic/biomarker signatures. In addition, supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence algorithms have the potential to combine different layers of data (imaging parameters and features, clinical variables and biomarkers) and elaborate complex and specific CHD risk models allowing more accurate diagnosis and reliable prognosis prediction. Literature from the past 5 years was systematically collected from PubMed and Scopus databases, and 60 studies were selected. We speculated the applicability of radiogenomics and artificial intelligence through the application of machine learning algorithms to identify CHD and characterize atherosclerotic lesions and myocardial abnormalities. Radiomic features extracted by cardiac computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance showed good diagnostic accuracy for the identification of coronary plaques and myocardium structure; on the other hand, few studies exploited radiogenomics integration, thus suggesting further research efforts in this field. Cardiac computed tomography angiography resulted the most used noninvasive imaging modality for artificial intelligence applications. Several studies provided high performance for CHD diagnosis, classification, and prognostic assessment even though several efforts are still needed to validate and standardize algorithms for CHD patient routine according to good medical practice.  © 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.",,

Specifically, the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver a very much efficient healthcare service. Objective: This article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements. Methods: To that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects. Results: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect. Conclusion: Soon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical activities, improving disease detection and treatment.

Whether the effects of oxygenation targets differ based on an individual's characteristics is unknown. Objective: To determine whether an individual's characteristics modify the effect of lower vs higher peripheral oxygenation-saturation (Spo2) targets on mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: A machine learning model to predict the effect of treatment with a lower vs higher Spo2 target on mortality for individual patients was derived in the Pragmatic Investigation of Optimal Oxygen Targets (PILOT) trial and externally validated in the Intensive Care Unit Randomized Trial Comparing Two Approaches to Oxygen Therapy (ICU-ROX) trial. Critically ill adults received invasive mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States between July 2018 and August 2021 for PILOT (n = 1682) and in 21 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand between September 2015 and May 2018 for ICU-ROX (n = 965). Exposures: Randomization to a lower vs higher Spo2 target group. Main Outcome and Measure: 28-Day mortality. Results: In the ICU-ROX validation cohort, the predicted effect of treatment with a lower vs higher Spo2 target for individual patients ranged from a 27.2% absolute reduction to a 34.4% absolute increase in 28-day mortality. For example, patients predicted to benefit from a lower Spo2 target had a higher prevalence of acute brain injury, whereas patients predicted to benefit from a higher Spo2 target had a higher prevalence of sepsis and abnormally elevated vital signs. Patients predicted to benefit from a lower Spo2 target experienced lower mortality when randomized to the lower Spo2 group, whereas patients predicted to benefit from a higher Spo2 target experienced lower mortality when randomized to the higher Spo2 group (likelihood ratio test for effect modification P =.02). The use of a Spo2 target predicted to be best for each patient, instead of the randomized Spo2 target, would have reduced the absolute overall mortality by 6.4% (95% CI, 1.9%-10.9%). Conclusion and relevance: Oxygenation targets that are individualized using machine learning analyses of randomized trials may reduce mortality for critically ill adults.

Physical examination data has the advantages of wide coverage, large capacity, and easy collection. Therefore, here we report a gender-specific cascading system for risk assessment of CHD based on physical examination data. The dataset consists of 39,538 CHD patients and 640,465 healthy individuals from the Luzhou Health Commission in Sichuan, China. Fifty physical examination characteristics were considered, and after feature screening, ten risk factors were identified. To facilitate large-scale CHD risk screening, a CHD risk model was developed using a fully connected network (FCN). For males, the model achieves AUCs of 0.8671 and 0.8659, respectively on the independent test set and the external validation set. For females, the AUCs of the model are 0.8991 and 0.9006, respectively on the independent test set and the external validation set. Furthermore, to enhance the convenience and flexibility of the model in clinical and real-life scenarios, we established a CHD risk scorecard base on logistic regression (LR). The results show that, for both males and females, the AUCs of the scorecard on the independent test set and the external verification set are only slightly lower (<0.05) than those of the corresponding prediction model, indicating that the scorecard construction does not result in a significant loss of information.

In an era of increasing need for precision medicine and quickly expanding TAVI indications, machine learning has shown promise in making accurate predictions of clinical outcomes. This study aims to predict different intrahospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI using a machine learning-based approach. The main clinical outcomes include all-cause mortality, stroke, major vascular complications, paravalvular leakage, and new pacemaker implantations. Methods and results: The dataset consists of 451 consecutive patients undergoing elective TAVI between February 2014 and June 2016. The applied machine learning methods were neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests. Their performance was evaluated using five-fold nested cross-validation. Considering all 83 features, the performance of all machine learning models in predicting all-cause intrahospital mortality (AUC 0.94–0.97) was significantly higher than both the STS risk score (AUC 0.64), the STS/ACC TAVR score (AUC 0.65), and all machine learning models using baseline characteristics only (AUC 0.72–0.82). Using an extreme boosting gradient, baseline troponin T was found to be the most important feature among all input variables. Overall, after feature selection, there was a slightly inferior performance.

Currently, the time and cost to progress from lead compound/product identification to the clinic, and the success rate in getting there reduces the incentive for industry to invest, despite the enormous burden of disease and potential size of market. There are tremendous opportunities with improved phenotyping of patients currently batched together in syndromic ""buckets.""

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the “participatory” medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population. © 2021, The Author(s).",,

Methods and results: Non-invasive CV imaging is essential to accurately and efficiently phenotype patients with heart disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). Various modalities, such as echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography (CT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and invasive coronary angiography, and in some cases a combination, can be required to provide sufficient information for diagnosis and management. Taking CAD as an example, imaging is essential for the detection and functional assessment of coronary stenoses, as well as for the quantification of cardiac function and ischaemic myocardial damage. Furthermore, imaging may detect and quantify coronary atherosclerosis, potentially identify plaques at increased risk of rupture, and guide coronary interventions. In patients with HF, imaging helps identify specific aetiologies, quantify damage, and assess its impact on cardiac function. Imaging plays a central role in individualizing diagnosis and management and to determine the optimal treatment for each patient to increase the likelihood of response and improve patient outcomes. Conclusions: Advances in all imaging techniques continue to improve accuracy, sensitivity, and standardization of functional and prognostic assessments, and identify established and novel therapeutic targets. Combining imaging with artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer algorithms, as well as with genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches, will become state of the art in the future to understand pathologies of CAD and HF, and in the development of new, targeted therapies.  © 2022 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

CVDs like Heart Failure (HF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF) are associated with physical effects on the heart muscles. As a result of the complex nature, progression, inherent genetic makeup, and heterogeneity of CVDs, personalized treatments are believed to be critical. Rightful application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can lead to new insights into CVDs for providing better personalized treatments with predictive analysis and deep phenotyping. In this study we focused on implementing AI/ML techniques on RNA-seq driven gene-expression data to investigate genes associated with HF, AF, and other CVDs, and predict disease with high accuracy. The study involved generating RNA-seq data derived from the serum of consented CVD patients. Next, we processed the sequenced data using our RNA-seq pipeline and applied GVViZ for gene-disease data annotation and expression analysis. To achieve our research objectives, we developed a new Findable, Accessible, Intelligent, and Reproducible (FAIR) approach that includes a five-level biostatistical evaluation, primarily based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. During our AI/ML analysis, we have fitted, trained, and implemented our model to classify and distinguish high-risk CVD patients based on their age, gender, and race. With the successful execution of our model, we predicted the association of highly significant HF, AF, and other CVDs genes with demographic variables. © 2023 The Author(s)",,

Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling. © 2020, The Author(s).",,

In this feasibility study, we aimed to elucidate plaque biology by decoding the molecular phenotype of plaques through analysis of computed-tomography angiography images, making a predictive model for plaque biology referred to as virtual transcriptomics. Approach and Results: We employed machine intelligence using paired computed-tomography angiography and transcriptomics from carotid endarterectomies of 40 patients undergoing stroke-preventive surgery for carotid stenosis. Computed tomography angiographies were analyzed with novel software for accurate characterization of plaque morphology and plaque transcriptomes obtained from microarrays, followed by mathematical modeling for prediction of molecular signatures. Four hundred fourteen coding and noncoding RNAs were robustly predicted using supervised models to estimate gene expression based on plaque morphology. Examples of predicted transcripts included ion transporters, cytokine receptors, and a number of microRNAs whereas pathway analyses demonstrated enrichment of several biological processes relevant for the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and plaque instability. Finally, the ability of the models to predict plaque gene expression was demonstrated using computed tomography angiographies from 4 sequestered patients and comparisons with transcriptomes of corresponding lesions. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study show that atherosclerotic plaque phenotyping by image analysis of conventional computed-tomography angiography can elucidate the molecular signature of atherosclerotic lesions in a multiscale setting. The study holds promise for optimized personalized therapy in the prevention of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, which warrants further investigations in larger cohorts. © 2021 American Heart Association, Inc.",,

Although RA has been described in the medical literature for over two hundred years, its etiology and pathophysiology are insufficiently understood. The current treatment of RA is mainly empirical or based on drugs that interfere with generic steps of the immune response, with limited efficacy and/or significant side effects. Much of RA research has been traditionally based on animals and simplistic in vitro models, which have been shown to poorly recapitulate human RA etiopathogenesis and drug responses. A revolution in science and technology has produced a new generation of more relevant and predictive tools. These tools, which include patient-derived cells, innovative 3D cell culture systems, computational analyses and models, together with omics and large-scale epidemiological studies represent novel and exciting approaches to enhance and forward RA research in a human biology-based perspective. After considering some pitfalls and flaws of traditional models, in this review we discuss novel tools applicable to design human-oriented RA research, while fostering the need for a more holistic and preventative approach to the disease. Our goal is to stimulate discussion, both at scientific and public level, on the need to explore new avenues in RA research and to support a paradigm-shift from animal-based towards human biology-based systems to better understand human pathophysiology and to develop more effective targeted therapies for personalized treatment and prevention. © The Authors, 2019.",,

We aim to develop a personalized prediction model that utilizes baseline patient characteristics prior to CLI diagnosis to predict subsequent 1-year all-cause hospitalizations and total annual healthcare cost, using a novel Bayesian machine learning platform, Reverse Engineering Forward Simulation™ (REFS™), to support a paradigm shift from reactive healthcare to Predictive Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM)-driven healthcare. Methods: Patients ≥ 50 years with CLI plus clinical activity for a 6-month pre-index and a 12-month post-index period or death during the post-index period were included in this retrospective cohort of the linked Optum-Humedica databases. REFS™ built an ensemble of 256 predictive models to identify predictors of all-cause hospitalizations and total annual all-cause healthcare costs during the 12-month post-index interval. Results: The mean age of 3189 eligible patients was 71.9 years. The most common CLI-related comorbidities were hypertension (79.5%), dyslipidemia (61.4%), coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease (42.3%), and type 2 diabetes (39.2%). Post-index CLI-related healthcare utilization included inpatient services (14.6%) and ≥ 1 outpatient visits (32.1%). Median annual all-cause and CLI-related costs per patient were $30,514 and $2196, respectively. REFS™ identified diagnosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue infections, cellulitis and abscess, use of nonselective beta-blockers, other aftercare, and osteoarthritis as high confidence predictors of all-cause hospitalizations. The leading predictors for total all-cause costs included region of residence and comorbid health conditions including other diseases of kidney and ureters, blindness of vision defects, chronic ulcer of skin, and chronic ulcer of leg or foot. Conclusions: REFS™ identified baseline predictors of subsequent healthcare resource utilization and costs in CLI patients.

Given the finite resources, it is important to identify individuals who would receive the most benefit from detecting positive CAC by screening. However, the evidence is limited as to whether the burden of positive CAC on CVD differs by multidimensional individual characteristics. We sought to investigate the heterogeneity in the association between positive CAC and incident CVD. Methods: This cohort study included adults from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) ages ≥45 years and free of cardiovascular disease. After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, we applied a machine learning causal forest model to (1) evaluate the heterogeneity in the association between positive CAC and incident CVD, and (2) predict the increase in CVD risk at 10-years when CAC>0 (versus CAC=0) at the individual level. We then compared the estimated increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 to the absolute 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk calculated by the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations. Results: Across 3328 adults in our propensity score-matched analysis, our causal forest model showed the heterogeneity in the association between CAC>0 and incident CVD. We found a dose-response relationship of the estimated increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 with higher 10-year ASCVD risk. Almost all individuals (2293 of 2428 [94.4%]) with borderline risk of ASCVD or higher showed ≥2.5% increase in CVD risk when CAC>0. Even among 900 adults with low ASCVD risk, 689 (69.2%) showed ≥2.5% increase in CVD risk when CAC>0; these individuals were more likely to be male, Hispanic, and have unfavorable CVD risk factors than others. Conclusions: The expected increases in CVD risk when CAC>0 were heterogeneous across individuals. Moreover, nearly 70% of people with low ASCVD risk showed a large increase in CVD risk when CAC>0, highlighting the need for CAC screening among such low-risk individuals. Future studies are needed to assess whether targeting individuals for CAC measurements based on not only the absolute ASCVD risk but also the expected increase in CVD risk when CAC>0 improves cardiovascular outcomes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Aim: Review new and emerging haemophilia therapies, including replacement and bypassing products, digital applications, utilisation of big data, and personalised medicine. Methods: Data were obtained from peer-reviewed presentations/publications, and ongoing studies in haemophilia, ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence (AI). Results: Available treatments include new recombinant factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), extended half-life FVIII/IX products, a new FVIIa product for inhibitor patients, and a FVIIIa-mimetic. Several novel therapeutics are in clinical trials, including FVIIIa mimetics and inhibitors of naturally-occurring anticoagulants. Ongoing gene therapy trials suggest that a single vector infusion using an optimised construct can produce factor activity that reduces bleeding to near zero for years.

We propose a two-part modeling technique separating the process into two distinct phases: (a) a binary classification task for predicting, whether a patient is more likely to present with a non-zero SYNTAX score; and (b) a regression task to predict the expected SYNTAX score accountable to individual patients with a non-zero SYNTAX score. The framework is based on data collected from the GESS trial (NCT03150680) comprising electronic medical and clinical records for 303 adult patients with suspected CAD,having undergone invasive coronary angiography in AHEPA University Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece.The deployment of the proposed approachd emonstrated that at her ogenicindex of plasma levels, diabetes mellitus and hypertension can be considered as important risk factors for discriminating patients into zero-and non-zero SYNTAX score groups, whereas diastolic and systolic arterial blood pressure, peripheral vascular disease and body mass index can be considered as significant risk factors for providing an accurate estimation of the expected SYNTAX score, given that a patient belongs to the non-zero SYNTAX score group. The experimental findings utilizing the identified set of important risk factors indicate a sufficient prediction performance for the Support Vector Machine model (classification task) with an F-measure score of ∼0.71 and the Support Vector Regression model (regression task) with a median absolute error value of ∼6.5.

Its weakness is a failure to resolve a clinical quandary: patients appear for care individually, each may differ in important ways from an RCT cohort, and the physician will wonder each time if following EBM will provide best guidance for this unique patient. In an effort to overcome this weakness, and promote higher quality care through a more personalized approach, a new framework has been proposed: Medicine-Based Evidence (MBE). In this approach, big data and deep learning techniques are embraced to interrogate treatment responses among patients in real-world clinical practice. Such statistical models are then integrated with mechanistic disease models to construct a “digital twin,” which serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a patient. MBE is thereby capable of dynamically modeling the effects of various treatment decisions in the context of an individual's specific characteristics. In this article, we discuss how MBE could benefit patients with congenital heart disease, a field where RCTs are difficult to conduct and often fail to provide definitive solutions because of a small number of subjects, their clinical complexity, and heterogeneity. We will also highlight the challenges that must be addressed before MBE can be embraced in clinical practice and its full potential can be realized.

The model performance on outcome prediction was compared between four machine learning algorithms. Methods: Retrospective, electronic clinical data for patients with suspected or confirmed osteoporosis treated at Wan Fang Hospital between 2011 to 2018 were used as inputs for building the following predictive machine learning models,i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) models. The predicted outcome was defined as an increase/decrease in T-score after treatment. A genetic algorithm was employed to select relevant variables as input features for each model; the leave-one-out method was applied for model building and internal validation. The model with best performance was selected by a separate set of testing. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and F1 score were calculated to evaluate model performance. Main analysis for all the patients with subclinical or confirmed osteoporosis and subgroup analysis for the patients with confirmed osteoporosis (T score < -2.5) were carried out in this study. Results: A genetic algorithm was employed to select 12 to 18 features from all 33 variables for the four models. No difference was found in accuracy (ANN, 71.7%; LR, 70.0%; RF, 75.0%; SVM, 66.7%), precision (ANN, 80.0%; LR, 59.3%; RF, 70.0%; SVM, 63.6%), and AUC (ANN, 0.709; LR, 0.731; RF, 0.719; SVM, 0.702) among the ANN, LR, RF and SVM models. Main analysis in performance revealed significant recall in the LR model, as compared to ANN and SVM model; while subgroup revealed significant recall in ANN model, compared to LR and SVM model. Conclusions: Machine learning-based models hold potential in forecasting the outcomes of treatment for osteoporosis via early initiation of first-line therapy for patients with subclinical disease; or a switch to second-line treatment for patients with a high risk of impending treatment failure. This convenient approach can assist clinicians in adjusting treatment tailored to individual patient for prevention of disease progression or ineffective therapy. © 2022",,

Second-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems introduce variability into treatment regimens to overcome the compensatory mechanisms underlying the loss of effectiveness of diuretics. This open-labeled, proof-of-concept clinical trial sought to investigate the ability to improve diuretic resistance by implementing algorithm-controlled therapeutic regimens. Methods: Ten CHF patients with diuretic resistance were enrolled in an open-labeled trial where the Altus Care™ app managed diuretics' dosage and administration times. The app provides a personalized therapeutic regimen creating variability in dosages and administration times within pre-defined ranges. Response to therapy was measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score, 6-minute walk test (SMW), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, and renal function. Results: The second-generation, AI-based, personalized regimen alleviated diuretic resistance. All evaluable patients demonstrated clinical improvement within ten weeks of intervention. A dose reduction (based on a three-week average before and last three weeks of intervention) was achieved in 7/10 patients (70 %, p = 0.042). The KCCQ score improved in 9/10 (90 %, p = 0.002), the SMW improved in 9/9 (100 %, p = 0.006), NT-proBNP was decreased in 7/10 (70 %, p = 0.02), and serum creatinine was decreased in 6/10 (60 %, p = 0.05). The intervention was associated with reduced number of emergency room visits and the number of CHF-associated hospitalizations. The results support that the randomization of diuretic regimens guided by a second-generation personalized AI algorithm improves the response to diuretic therapy. Prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. © 2023 The Authors",,

Reinforcement learning is an appealing method for developing efficient policies in various healthcare areas where the decision-making process is typically defined by a long period or a sequential process. In our research, we leverage the power of reinforcement learning and electronic health records of South Koreans to dynamically recommend treatment prescriptions, which are personalized based on patient information of hypertension. Our proposed reinforcement learning-based treatment recommendation system decides whether to use mono, dual, or triple therapy according to the state of the hypertension patients. We evaluated the performance of our personalized treatment recommendation model by lowering the occurrence of hypertension-related complications and blood pressure levels of patients who followed our model’s recommendation. With our findings, we believe that our proposed hypertension treatment recommendation model could assist doctors in prescribing appropriate antihypertensive medications. © 2021 by the authors.

Telomeres represent a compelling biomarker of individual radiosensitivity and risk, as exposure can result in dysfunctional telomere pathologies that coincidentally overlap with many radiation-induced late effects, ranging from degenerative conditions like fibrosis and cardiovascular disease to proliferative pathologies like cancer. Here, telomere length was longitudinally assessed in a cohort of fifteen prostate cancer patients undergoing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) utilizing Telomere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (Telo-FISH). To evaluate genome instability and enhance predictions for individual patient risk of secondary malignancy, chromosome aberrations were assessed utilizing directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH) for high-resolution inversion detection.

Like any other (health) data, RWD can be analysed in accordance with high-quality research methods, and its analysis can deliver valuable patient-centric insights complementing the information obtained from conventional clinical trials. Artificial intelligence application on RWD has the potential to detect a patient's health trajectory leading to personalized medicine and tailored treatment.

Hospitals have accumulated a wealth of health-related data, including patients’ test reports, treatment histories, and diagnostic records, to better understand patients’ health, safety, and disease progression. Extracting relevant information from this data enables physicians to provide personalized patient-treatment recommendations. While collaborative filtering techniques and classical algorithms such as naive Bayes, logistic regression, and decision trees have had notable success in health-recommendation systems, most current systems primarily inform users of their likely preferences without providing explanations. This paper proposes an approach of deep learning with a local interpretable model–agnostic explanations (LIME)-based interpretable recommendation system to solve this problem. Specifically, we apply the proposed approach to two chronic diseases common in older adults: heart disease and diabetes. After data preprocessing, we use six deep-learning algorithms to form interpretations. In the heart-disease data set, the actual model recommendation of multi-layer perceptron and gradient-boosting algorithm differs from the local model’s recommendation of LIME, which can be used as its approximate prediction. From the feature importance of these two algorithms, it can be seen that the CholCheck, GenHith, and HighBP features are the most important for predicting heart disease. In the diabetes data set, the actual model predictions of the multi-layer perceptron and logistic-regression algorithm were little different from the local model’s prediction of LIME, which can be used as its approximate recommendation. Moreover, from the feature importance of the two algorithms, it can be seen that the three features of glucose, BMI, and age were the most important for predicting heart disease. Next, LIME is used to determine the importance of each feature that affected the results of the calculated model. Subsequently, we present the contribution coefficients of these features to the final recommendation. By analyzing the impact of different patient characteristics on the recommendations, our proposed system elucidates the underlying reasons behind these recommendations and enhances patient trust. This approach has important implications for medical recommendation systems and encourages informed decision-making in healthcare. © 2023 by the authors.",,

Because HFpEF is a heterogeneous syndrome and resistant to a “one-size-fits-all” approach it has proven to be very difficult to treat. For this reason, several research groups have been working on methods for classifying HFpEF and testing targeted therapeutics for the HFpEF subtypes identified. Apart from conventional classification strategies based on comorbidity, etiology, left ventricular remodeling, and hemodynamic subtypes, researchers have been combining deep phenotyping with innovative analytical strategies (e.g., machine learning) to classify HFpEF into therapeutically homogeneous subtypes over the past few years. Despite the growing excitement for such approaches, there are several potential pitfalls to their use, and there is a pressing need to follow up on data-driven HFpEF subtypes in order to determine their underlying mechanisms and molecular basis. Here we provide a framework for understanding the phenotype-based approach to HFpEF by reviewing (1) the historical context of HFpEF; (2) the current HFpEF paradigm of comorbidity-induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction; (3) various methods of sub-phenotyping HFpEF; (4) comorbidity-based classification and treatment of HFpEF; (5) machine learning approaches to classifying HFpEF; (6) examples from HFpEF clinical trials; and (7) the future of phenomapping (machine learning and other advanced analytics) for the classification of HFpEF. © 2022, The Author(s).",,

However, their implications in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis could be identified as valuable starting points for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for IAs. The transcriptional profiles of 75 IAs and 37 control samples were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to screen key genes. The ssGSEA algorithm was performed to establish phenotype scores. The correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis was evaluated using functional enrichment crossover, phenotype score correlation, immune infiltration, and interaction network construction. The IA diagnostic values of key genes were identified using machine learning. Finally, we performed the single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to explore mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis at the cellular level. In total, 42 IA-mitochondrial DEGs and 15 IA-necroptosis DEGs were identified. Screening revealed seven key genes invovled in mitochondrial dysfunction (KMO, HADH, BAX, AADAT, SDSL, PYCR1, and MAOA) and five genes involved in necroptosis (IL1B, CAMK2G, STAT1, NLRP3, and BAX). Machine learning confirmed the high diagnostic value of these key genes for IA. The IA samples showed higher expression of mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis exhibited a close association. Furthermore, scRNA-seq indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis were preferentially up-regulated in monocytes/macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within IA lesions. In conclusion, mitochondria-induced necroptosis was involved in IA formation, and was mainly up-regulated in monocytes/macrophages and VSMCs within IA lesions.

This was a single-center retrospective study including 104 consecutive adults undergoing urgent or elective non-cardiac surgery with moderate-to-high risk of bleeding, requiring invasive blood pressure and continuous cardiac output monitoring. Depending on the sensor, two comparable groups were identified: patients managed following the institutional protocol of personalized goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT, n = 52), or this GDFT supported by the HPI (HPI, n = 52). The time-weighted average of hypotension for a mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg (TWAMAP<65), postoperative complications and length of hospital stay (LOS) were automatically downloaded from medical records and revised by clinicians blinded to the management received by patients. Differences in preoperative variables (i.e. physical status -ASA class-, acute kidney Injury-AKI- risk) and outcomes were analyzed using non-parametric tests with Hodges-Lehmann estimator for the median of differences. ASA class and AKI risk were similar (p = 0.749 and p = 0.837, respectively). Blood loss was also comparable (p = 0.279). HPI patients had a lower TWAMAP<65 [0.09 mmHg (0–0.48 mmHg)] vs [0.23 mmHg (0.01 to 0.97 mmHg)], p = 0.037. Postoperative complications were less prevalent in the HPI patients (0.46 ± 0.98 vs. 0.88 ± 1.20), p = 0.035.

A model based on L1 regularized logistic regression was trained against the South Korean nationwide administrative claims database to identify risk factors for the incident MDD after beta-blocker therapy in patients with CVD. We identified 50,397 patients initiating beta-blockers for CVD, with 774 patients developing MDD within 365 days after initiating beta-blocker therapy. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 was achieved. A history of non-selective beta-blockers and factors related to anxiety disorder, sleeping problems, and other chronic diseases were the most strong predictors. AUCs of 0.62–0.71 were achieved in the external validation conducted on six independent electronic health records and claims databases in the USA and South Korea.

Using a machine learning approach, this study aimed to leverage the prospective Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) to identify a BMI threshold for patients undergoing surgical intervention for grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis and thus reliably identify optimal surgical candidates among obese patients. METHODS Patients with grade 1 lumbar spondylolisthesis and preoperative BMI ≥ 30 from the prospectively collected QOD lumbar spondylolisthesis module were included in this study. A 12-month composite outcome was generated by performing principal components analysis and k-means clustering on four validated measures of surgical outcomes in patients with spondylolisthesis. Random forests were generated to determine the most important preoperative patient characteristics in predicting the composite outcome. Recursive partitioning was used to extract a BMI threshold associated with optimal outcomes. RESULTS The average BMI was 35.7, with 282 (46.4%) of the 608 patients from the QOD data set having a BMI ≥ 30. Principal components analysis revealed that the first principal component accounted for 99.2% of the variance in the four outcome measures. Two clusters were identified corresponding to patients with suboptimal outcomes (severe back pain, increased disability, impaired quality of life, and low satisfaction) and to those with optimal outcomes. Recursive partitioning established a BMI threshold of 37.5 after pruning via cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study, the authors found that a BMI ≤ 37.5 was associated with improved patient outcomes following surgical intervention.

Methods: Chronic cocaine users with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were prospectively enrolled to undergo cash-based contingency management to achieve cocaine abstinence. Participants underwent coronary CTA at baseline and 6 and 12 months following recruitment. We segmented all coronary plaques and extracted 1103 radiomic features. We implemented weighted correlation network analysis to derive consensus eigen radiomic features (named as different colors) and used linear mixed models and mediation analysis to assess whether cocaine abstinence affects plaque morphology correcting for clinical variables and plaque volumes and whether serum biomarkers causally mediate these changes. Furthermore, we used Bayesian hidden Markov network changepoint analysis to assess the potential rewiring of the radiomic network. Results: Sixty-nine PLWH (median age 55 IQR: 52–59 years, 19% female) completed the study, of whom 26 achieved total abstinence. Twenty consensus eigen radiomic features were derived. Cocaine abstinence significantly affected the pink and cyan eigen features (−0.04 CI: [−0.06; −0.02], p = 0.0009; 0.03 CI: [0.001; 0.04], p = 0.0017, respectively). These effects were mediated through changes in endothelin-1 levels. In abstinent individuals, we observed significant rewiring of the latent radiomic signature network. Conclusions: Using our proposed framework, we found 1 year of cocaine abstinence to significantly change specific latent coronary plaque morphological features and rewire the latent morphologic network above and beyond changes in plaque volumes and clinical characteristics. Key Points: • We propose a general methodology to decompose the latent morphology of lesions on radiological images using a radiomics-based systems biology approach. • As a proof-of-principle, we show that 1 year of cocaine abstinence results in significant changes in specific latent coronary plaque morphologic features and rewiring of the latent morphologic network above and beyond changes in plaque volumes and clinical characteristics. • We found endothelin-1 levels to mediate these structural changes providing potential pathological pathways warranting further investigation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.",,

Methods: We conducted statistical and machine learning approaches to evaluate 10-year risk of these outcomes among 1934 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 2006 and 2007. Overall CVH scores were classified as poor, intermediate, or ideal for 5 factors, smoking, body mass index, blood pressure, glucose/hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol from clinical data within 5 years prior to the breast cancer diagnosis. The receipt of potentially cardiotoxic breast cancer treatments was indicated if the patient received anthracyclines or hormone therapies. We modeled the outcomes of post-cancer diagnosis CHD and death, respectively. Results: Results of these approaches indicated that the joint effect of poor CVH and receipt of cardiotoxic treatments on CHD (75.9%) and death (39.5%) was significantly higher than their independent effects [poor CVH (55.9%) and cardiotoxic treatments (43.6%) for CHD, and poor CVH (29.4%) and cardiotoxic treatments (35.8%) for death]. Conclusions: Better CVH appears to be protective against the development of CHD even among women who had received potentially cardiotoxic treatments.

Objective: We aimed to examine health care workers’ opinions about the adoption and implementation of AI-powered technology in the health care industry. Methods: Data were comments about AI posted on a web-based forum by 905 health care professionals from at least 77 countries, from May 2013 to October 2021. Structural topic modeling was used to identify the topics of discussion, and hierarchical clustering was performed to determine how these topics cluster into different groups. Results: Overall, 12 topics were identified from the collected comments. These comments clustered into 2 groups: impact of AI on health care system and practice and AI as a tool for disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Topics associated with negative sentiments included concerns about AI replacing human workers, impact of AI on traditional medical diagnostic procedures (ie, patient history and physical examination), accuracy of the algorithm, and entry of IT companies into the health care industry. Concerns about the legal liability for using AI in treating patients were also discussed. Positive topics about AI included the opportunity offered by the technology for improving the accuracy of image-based diagnosis and for enhancing personalized medicine. Conclusions: The adoption and implementation of AI applications in the health care industry are eliciting both enthusiasm and concerns about patient care quality and the future of health care professions.

Although CVD events do not typically manifest until older adulthood, CVD develops gradually across the life-course, beginning with the elevation of risk factors observed as early as childhood or adolescence and the emergence of subclinical disease that can occur in young adulthood or midlife. Genomic background, which is determined at zygote formation, is among the earliest risk factors for CVD. With major advances in molecular technology, including the emergence of gene-editing techniques, along with deep whole-genome sequencing and high-throughput array-based genotyping, scientists now have the opportunity to not only discover genomic mechanisms underlying CVD but use this knowledge for the life-course prevention and treatment of these conditions. The current review focuses on innovations in the field of genomics and their applications to monogenic and polygenic CVD prevention and treatment. With respect to monogenic CVD, we discuss how the emergence of whole-genome sequencing technology has accelerated the discovery of disease-causing variants, allowing comprehensive screening and early, aggressive CVD mitigation strategies in patients and their families. We further describe advances in gene editing technology, which might soon make possible cures for CVD conditions once thought untreatable. In relation to polygenic CVD, we focus on recent innovations that leverage findings of genome-wide association studies to identify druggable gene targets and develop predictive genomic models of disease, which are already facilitating breakthroughs in the life-course treatment and prevention of CVD. Gaps in current research and future directions of genomics studies are also discussed. In aggregate, we hope to underline the value of leveraging genomics and broader multiomics information for characterizing CVD conditions, work which promises to expand precision approaches for the life-course prevention and treatment of CVD. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A large volume of research findings from observational studies about disease interactions with COVID-19 is being produced almost daily, making it difficult for physicians to keep track of the latest information on COVID-19’s effect on patients with certain pre-existing conditions. Objective: In this paper, we describe the creation of a clinical decision support tool, the SMART COVID Navigator, a web application to assist clinicians in treating patients with COVID-19. Our application allows clinicians to access a patient’s electronic health records and identify disease interactions from a large set of observational research studies that affect the severity and fatality due to COVID-19. Methods: The SMART COVID Navigator takes a 2-pronged approach to clinical decision support. The first part is a connection to electronic health record servers, allowing the application to access a patient’s medical conditions. The second is accessing data sets with information from various observational studies to determine the latest research findings about COVID-19 outcomes for patients with certain medical conditions. By connecting these 2 data sources, users can see how a patient’s medical history will affect their COVID-19 outcomes. Results: The SMART COVID Navigator aggregates patient health information from multiple Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources–enabled electronic health record systems. This allows physicians to see a comprehensive view of patient health records. The application accesses 2 data sets of over 1100 research studies to provide information on the fatality and severity of COVID-19 for several pre-existing conditions. We also analyzed the results of the collected studies to determine which medical conditions result in an increased chance of severity and fatality of COVID-19 progression. We found that certain conditions result in a higher likelihood of severity and fatality probabilities. We also analyze various cancer tissues and find that the probabilities for fatality vary greatly depending on the tissue being examined. Conclusions: The SMART COVID Navigator allows physicians to predict the fatality and severity of COVID-19 progression given a particular patient’s medical conditions. This can allow physicians to determine how aggressively to treat patients infected with COVID-19 and to prioritize different patients for treatment considering their prior medical conditions. ©Varun Suraj, Catherine Del Vecchio Fitz, Laura B Kleiman, Suresh K Bhavnani, Chinmay Jani, Surbhi Shah, Rana R McKay, Jeremy Warner, Gil Alterovitz.",,

Precision management of hypertension is important, because both susceptibility to complications and response to treatment vary between individuals. While the use of genomic and proteomic personal features for widespread precision hypertension management is not practical, other features, such as age, ethnicity, and cardiovascular diseases, have been utilized in guidelines for hypertension management. In precision medicine, more blood-pressure-related clinical and physiological characteristics in the patient’s profile can be utilized for the determination of the threshold of hypertension and optimal treatment. Several non-invasive and simple-to-use techniques for the measurement of hypertension-related physiological features are suggested for use in precision management of hypertension. In order to provide precise management of hypertension, accurate measurement of blood pressure is required, but the available non-invasive blood pressure measurement techniques, auscultatory sphygmomanometry and oscillometry, have inherent significant inaccuracy—either functional or technological—limiting the precision of personalized management of hypertension. A novel photoplethysmography-based technique for the measurement of systolic blood pressure that was recently found to be more accurate than the two available techniques can be utilized for more precise and personalized hypertension management. © 2022 by the authors.",,

Heart failure patients in LMIC also experience a higher mortality rate. Innovative ways that can risk stratify heart failure patients in this region are needed. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of machine learning in predicting all-cause mortality in heart failure patients hospitalised in a tertiary academic centre. Methods: Six supervised machine learning algorithms were trained to predict in-hospital all-cause mortality using data from 500 consecutive heart failure patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50%. Results: The mean age was 55.2 ± 16.8 years. There were 271 (54.2%) males, and the mean LVEF was 29 ± 9.2%. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days (interquartile range: 4–11), and it did not differ between patients discharged alive and those who died. After a prediction window of 4 years (interquartile range: 2–6), 84 (16.8%) patients died before discharge from the hospital. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.82, 0.78, 0.77, 0.76, 0.75, and 0.62 for random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and decision trees, and the accuracy during the test phase was 88, 87, 86, 82, 78, and 76% for random forest, MLP, SVM, extreme gradient boosting, decision trees, and logistic regression. The support vector machines were the best performing algorithm, and furosemide, beta-blockers, spironolactone, early diastolic murmur, and a parasternal heave had a positive coefficient with the target feature, whereas coronary artery disease, potassium, oedema grade, ischaemic cardiomyopathy, and right bundle branch block on electrocardiogram had negative coefficients. Conclusion: Despite a small sample size, supervised machine learning algorithms successfully predicted all-cause mortality with modest accuracy. The SVM model will be externally validated using data from multiple cardiology centres in South Africa before developing a uniquely African risk prediction tool that can potentially transform heart failure management through precision medicine.

Early prediction of the ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS) of these patients is of great significance and can guide treatment while reducing the mortality rate among patients. However, conventional linear models have tended to perform worse than non-linear models. Materials and Methods: We collected the clinical data of 365 patients from Wuhan Union Hospital who underwent heart transplantation surgery between April 2017 and August 2020. The patients were randomly divided into training data (N = 256) and test data (N = 109) groups. 84 clinical features were collected for each patient. Features were validated using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression’s fivefold cross-validation method. We obtained Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) values by executing package “shap” to interpret model predictions. Four machine learning models and logistic regression algorithms were developed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was used to compare the prediction performance of different models. Finally, for the convenience of clinicians, an online web-server was established and can be freely accessed via the website https://wuhanunion.shinyapps.io/PredictICUStay/. Results: In this study, 365 consecutive patients undergoing heart transplantation surgery for moderate (NYHA grade 3) or severe (NYHA grade 4) heart failure were collected in Wuhan Union Hospital from 2017 to 2020. The median age of the recipient patients was 47.2 years, while the median age of the donors was 35.58 years. 330 (90.4%) of the donor patients were men, and the average surgery duration was 260.06 min. Among this cohort, 47 (12.9%) had renal complications, 25 (6.8%) had hepatic complications, 11 (3%) had undergone chest re-exploration and 19 (5.2%) had undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The following six important clinical features were selected using LASSO regression, and according to the result of SHAP, the rank of importance was (1) the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); (2) donor age; (3) the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP); (4) length of surgery; (5) high creatinine (Cr); and (6) the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm presented significantly better predictive performance (AUC-ROC = 0.88) than other models [Accuracy: 0.87; sensitivity: 0.98; specificity: 0.51; positive predictive value (PPV): 0.86; negative predictive value (NPV): 0.93]. Conclusion: Using the XGBoost classifier with heart transplantation patients can provide an accurate prediction of ICU-LOS, which will not only improve the accuracy of clinical decision-making but also contribute to the allocation and management of medical resources; it is also a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals.

Yet, most network-based approaches rely on a comprehensive map of protein–protein interactions (PPI), ignoring interactions mediated by noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Here, we systematically combine experimentally confirmed binding interactions mediated by ncRNA with PPI, constructing a comprehensive network of all physical interactions in the human cell. We find that the inclusion of ncRNA expands the number of genes in the interactome by 46% and the number of interactions by 107%, significantly enhancing our ability to identify disease modules. Indeed, we find that 132 diseases lacked a statistically significant disease module in the protein-based interactome but have a statistically significant disease module after inclusion of ncRNA-mediated interactions, making these diseases accessible to the tools of network medicine. We show that the inclusion of ncRNAs helps unveil disease–disease relationships that were not detectable before and expands our ability to predict comorbidity patterns between diseases. Taken together, we find that including noncoding interactions improves both the breath and the predictive accuracy of network medicine. Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).",,

They constitute the leading cause of disabilities, increased morbidity, mortality, and socio-economic disasters worldwide. Medical condition-specific digital biomarker (DB) panels have emerged as valuable tools to manage NCDs. DBs refer to the measurable and quantifiable physiological, behavioral, and environmental parameters collected for an individual through innovative digital health technologies, including wearables, smart devices, and medical sensors. By leveraging digital technologies, healthcare providers can gather real-time data and insights, enabling them to deliver more proactive and tailored interventions to individuals at risk and patients diagnosed with NCDs. Continuous monitoring of relevant health parameters through wearable devices or smartphone applications allows patients and clinicians to track the progression of NCDs in real time. With the introduction of digital biomarker monitoring (DBM), a new quality of primary and secondary healthcare is being offered with promising opportunities for health risk assessment and protection against health-to-disease transitions in vulnerable sub-populations. DBM enables healthcare providers to take the most cost-effective targeted preventive measures, to detect disease developments early, and to introduce personalized interventions. Consequently, they benefit the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals, healthcare economy, and society at large. DBM is instrumental for the paradigm shift from reactive medical services to 3PM approach promoted by the European Association for Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (EPMA) involving 3PM experts from 55 countries worldwide. This position manuscript consolidates multi-professional expertise in the area, demonstrating clinically relevant examples and providing the roadmap for implementing 3PM concepts facilitated through DBs. © The Author(s) 2024.",,

There is a substantial inter-individual variability in the absorption of statins usually caused by genetic polymorphisms leading to a variation in the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters, which may affect drug therapy safety and efficacy. Therefore, the investigation of metabolic markers associated with rosuvastatin inter-individual variability is exceedingly relevant for drug therapy optimization and minimizing side effects. This work describes the application of pharmacometabolomic strategies using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to investigate endogenous plasma metabolites capable of predicting pharmacokinetic parameters in predose samples. First, a targeted method for the determination of plasma concentration levels of rosuvastatin was validated and applied to obtain the pharmacokinetic parameters from 40 enrolled individuals; then, predose samples were analyzed using a metabolomic approach to search for associations between endogenous metabolites and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters. Data processing using machine learning revealed some candidates including sterols and bile acids, carboxylated metabolites, and lipids, suggesting the approach herein described as promising for personalized drug therapy.

Methods and results: We integrated demographic, clinical, and molecular data (n = 124) with ultrasonographic carotid measurements from study participants in the IMPROVE cohort (n = 3340). We applied a neural network algorithm and hierarchical clustering to identify carotid atherosclerosis endotypes. A measure of carotid subclinical atherosclerosis, the c-IMTmean-max, was used to extract atherosclerosis-related features and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to reveal endotypes. The association of endotypes with carotid ultrasonographic measurements at baseline, after 30 months, and with the 3-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was estimated by linear (β, SE) and Cox [hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI)] regression models. Crude estimates were adjusted by common cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline ultrasonographic measures. Improvement in ASCVD risk prediction was evaluated by C-statistic and by net reclassification improvement with reference to SCORE2, c-IMTmean-max, and presence of carotid plaques. An ensemble stacking model was used to predict endotypes in an independent validation cohort, the PIVUS (n = 1061). We identified four endotypes able to differentiate carotid atherosclerosis risk profiles from mild (endotype 1) to severe (endotype 4). SHAP identified endotype-shared variables (age, biological sex, and systolic blood pressure) and endotype-specific biomarkers. In the IMPROVE, as compared to endotype 1, endotype 4 associated with the thickest c-IMT at baseline (β, SE) 0.36 (0.014), the highest number of plaques 1.65 (0.075), the fastest c-IMT progression 0.06 (0.013), and the highest ASCVD risk (HR, 95% CI) (1.95, 1.18-3.23). Baseline and progression measures of carotid subclinical atherosclerosis and ASCVD risk were associated with the predicted endotypes in the PIVUS. Endotypes consistently improved measures of ASCVD risk discrimination and reclassification in both study populations. Conclusions: We report four replicable subclinical carotid atherosclerosis-endotypes associated with progression of atherosclerosis and ASCVD risk in two independent populations. Our approach based on endotypes can be applied for precision medicine in ASCVD prevention.  © 2023 The Author(s).

They are morpho-functionally classified as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy with the addition of the left ventricular non-dilated cardiomyopathy that describes intermediate phenotypes not fulfilling standard disease definitions despite the presence of myocardial disease on cardiac imaging or tissue analysis. The new ESC guidelines provide 'a guide to the diagnostic approach to cardiomyopathies, highlight general evaluation and management issues, and signpost the reader to the relevant evidence base for the recommendations'. The recommendations and suggestions included in the document provide the tools to build up pathways tailored to specific cardiomyopathy (phenotype and cause) and define therapeutic indications, including target therapies where possible. The impact is on clinical cardiology, where disease- specific care paths can be assisted by the guidelines, and on genetics, both clinics and testing, where deep phenotyping and participated multi-disciplinary evaluation provide a unique tool for validating the pathogenicity of variants. The role of endomyocardial biopsy remains underexploited and confined to particular forms of restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and amyloidosis.

Data-driven tools and novel technologies have the capability to address these shortcomings, but insights from all stakeholders in the care continuum remain lacking. A structured online questionnaire was given to respondents (n = 1432) in nine global geographies to investigate attitudes to the use of data and novel technologies in the management of vascular disease. Patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease (n = 961), physicians responsible for their care (n = 345), and administrators/healthcare leaders with responsibility for commissioning/procuring cardiovascular services (n = 126) were included. Narrative themes arising from the survey included patients’ desire for more personalized healthcare, shared decision-making, and improved communication. Patients, administrators, and physicians perceived and experienced deficiencies in continuity of care, and all acknowledged the potential for data-driven techniques and novel technologies to address some of these shortcomings. Further, physicians and administrators saw the ‘upstream’ segment of the care journey—before diagnosis, at point of diagnosis, and when determining treatment—as key to enabling tangible improvements in patient experience and outcomes. Finally, despite acceptance that data sharing is critical to the success of such interventions, there remains persistent issues related to trust and transparency. The current fragmented care continuum could be improved and streamlined through the adoption of advanced data analytics and novel technologies, including diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Such an approach could enable the refocusing of healthcare from intermittent contacts and intervention-only focus to a more holistic patient view. © The Author(s) 2022.

Here we propose a stochastic platelet deposition model and an inferential scheme to estimate the biologically meaningful model parameters using approximate Bayesian computation with a summary statistic that maximally discriminates between different types of patients.

Unfortunately, many of the key diagnostic tools for CHD are insensitive, invasive, and costly; require significant specialized infrastructure investments; and do not provide information to guide postdiagnosis therapy. In prior work using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provided in silico evidence that integrated genetic–epigenetic tools may provide a new avenue for assessing CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this communication, we use an improved machine learning approach and data from 2 additional cohorts, totaling 449 cases and 2067 controls, to develop a better model for ascertaining symptomatic CHD. Using the DNA from the 2 new cohorts, we translate and validate the in silico findings into an artificial intelligence–guided, clinically implementable method that uses input from 6 methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction and 10 genotyping assays. Using this method, the overall average area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity in the 3 test cohorts is 82%, 79%, and 76%, respectively. Analysis of targeted cytosine-phospho-guanine loci shows that they map to key risk pathways involved in atherosclerosis that suggest specific therapeutic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this scalable integrated genetic–epigenetic approach is useful for the diagnosis of symptomatic CHD, performs favorably as compared with many existing methods, and may provide personalized insight to CHD therapy. Furthermore, given the dynamic nature of DNA methylation and the ease of methylation-sensitive digital polymerase chain reaction methodologies, these findings may pave a pathway for precision epigenetic approaches for monitoring CHD treatment response. © 2023 The Authors and Cardio Diagnostics, Inc.",,

Not only may these applications be beneficial to patients but also to institutions and payors because they may inform potential cost expenditure, improve overall hospital efficiency, and help anticipate resource utilization.AI infrastructure development requires institutional financial commitment and a team of clinicians and data scientists with expertise in AI that can complement skill sets and knowledge. Once a team is established and a goal is determined, teams (1) obtain, curate, and label data; (2) establish a reference standard; (3) develop an AI model; (4) evaluate the performance of the AI model; (5) externally validate the model, and (6) reinforce, improve, and evaluate the model's performance until clinical implementation is possible.Understanding the implications of AI in orthopaedics may eventually lead to wide-ranging improvements in patient care. However, AI, while holding tremendous promise, is not without methodological and ethical limitations that are essential to address. First, it is important to ensure external validity of programs before their use in a clinical setting. Investigators should maintain high quality data records and registry surveillance, exercise caution when evaluating others' reported AI applications, and increase transparency of the methodological conduct of current models to improve external validity and avoid propagating bias. By addressing these challenges and responsibly embracing the potential of AI, the medical field may eventually be able to harness its power to improve patient care and outcomes. © 2024 Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Inc..

The complexity and long-term dynamics of influencing factors make personalized management inevitable and challenging. This protocol describes Personalized Hypertension Management in Anhui, China (PHMA), a project that uses a package of innovative approaches in tailoring interventions to individual patient’s dynamic complications and contexts. Methods/design: PHMA strives to reduce hypertension harms by eight “objective behaviors” (e.g., self-monitoring and reporting, healthy diet, physical exercise/activities). These objective behaviors are promoted through five intervention measures: support for self- monitoring, supervised machine communications, daily education or reminder messages, weekly blood pressure notification, and quarterly signed feedback. PHMA uses ten categories and over 300 variables in selecting and refining intervention procedures and content for individual patients. Efficacy of the intervention package is evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial design involving a total of 60 site communities and 3352 hypertension patients. Primary measure for the evaluation is systolic and diastolic blood pressure; while secondary evaluation measures include quality of life (EQ5D-5L), occurrence of hypertension-related complications (such as cerebral hemorrhage, coronary heart disease, myocardial or cerebral infarction), healthcare utilization and scores of objective behaviors. Discussion: PHMA uses novel, low cost and sustainable approaches to tailor interventions to the dynamic conditions and contexts of individual patients. Unlike contemporary approaches to hypertension management which are mainly population based, each participant patient in PHMA applies a unique intervention package and all messages, feedbacks and other materials sent out to individual patients are different from each other. PHMA is the first project that adopts comprehensive tailoring and if proved effective, it should have important implications for future research, practice and policy-making.

Accurately predicting echocardiographic parameters, such as the size of the left ventricular (LV) area and the ejection fraction (EF), is crucial for the precise diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, limited data annotations are typically available for medical data, leading to substantial disparities among the segmentation accuracies obtained by deep learning models across different frames, and varying degrees of overfitting are observed in EF prediction tasks. In this work, a joint mask-augmented adaptive scale alignment (ASA) and periodicity-aware EF prediction method is proposed for cardiac function assessment. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of LV segmentation and EF prediction. First, an enhanced strategy is proposed to optimize LV segmentation to address the considerable segmentation accuracy variations across different frames. Second, variants of the ASA method are presented to perform regional alignment in EF prediction tasks, and an existing dataset is extended to address model overfitting. Third, a periodicity-aware method is proposed for EF and keyframe prediction, correcting the unfocused attention of the model for different periods and frames within the same video. Finally, experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset show that our method achieves segmentation accuracy of 91.51% at end-diastole (ED) and 93.55% at end-systole (ES), surpassing previous methods by 1.12% and 0.59%, respectively. The mean absolute error (MAE) in the EF prediction task is 3.92, and the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.822, demonstrating that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

The quality of data has an impact on diagnosis because medical data are usually sparse, imbalanced, and contain irrelevant attributes, resulting in suboptimal diagnosis. To address the impacts of data challenges, improve resource allocation, and achieve better health outcomes, a novel visual learning approach is proposed. This study contributes to the visual learning approach by determining whether less or more synthetic data are required to improve the quality of a dataset, such as the number of observations and features, according to the intended personalised treatment and early diagnosis. In addition, numerous visualisation experiments are conducted, including using statistical characteristics, cumulative sums, histograms, correlation matrix, root mean square error, and principal component analysis in order to visualise both original and synthetic data to address the data challenges. Real medical datasets for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, cryotherapy and immunotherapy are selected as case studies. As a benchmark and point of classification comparison in terms of such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, several models are implemented such as k-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest. To simulate algorithm implementation and data, Generative Adversarial Network is used to create and manipulate synthetic data, whilst, Random Forest is implemented to classify the data. An amendable and adaptable system is constructed by combining Generative Adversarial Network and Random Forest models. The system model presents working steps, overview and flowchart. Experiments reveal that the majority of data-enhancement scenarios allow for the application of visual learning in the first stage of data analysis as a novel approach. To achieve meaningful adaptable synergy between appropriate quality data and optimal classification performance while maintaining statistical characteristics, visual learning provides researchers and practitioners with practical human-in-the-loop machine learning visualisation tools. Prior to implementing algorithms, the visual learning approach can be used to actualise early, and personalised diagnosis. For the immunotherapy data, the Random Forest performed best with precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 81%, 82%, 81%, 88%, 95%, and 60%, as opposed to 91%, 96%, 93%, 93%, 96%, and 73% for synthetic data, respectively. Future studies might examine the optimal strategies to balance the quantity and quality of medical data. © 2023 The Author(s)",,

Since the 2010s, drugs for treating pulmonary hypertension based on mechanisms other than pulmonary vasodilation have been actively developed. However, precision medicine is based on tailoring disease treatment to particular phenotypes by molecular-targeted drugs. Since interleukin-6 (IL-6) is involved in the development of PAH in animal models, and some patients with PAH have elevated IL-6 levels, the cytokine is expected to obtain potentials for therapeutic targeting. Accordingly, we identified a phenotype with elevated cytokine activity of the IL-6 family in the PAH population by combining case data extracted from the Japan Pulmonary Hypertension Registry with a comprehensive analysis of 48 cytokines using artificial intelligence clustering techniques. Including an IL-6 threshold ≥2.73 pg/mL as inclusion criteria for reducing the risk of insufficient efficacy, an investigator-initiated clinical study using satralizumab, a recycling anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody, for patients with an immune-responsive phenotype is underway. This study is intended to test whether use of patient biomarker profile can identify a phenotype responsive to anti-IL6 therapy. © 2023 The Authors.

To characterize the precise syndromes, precise diseases and precise targets of the precise targets between complex diseases and CHM formulas, we developed an artificial intelligence-based quantitative predictive algorithm (DeepTCM). DeepTCM has gone through multilevel model calibration and validation against a comprehensive set of herb and disease data so that it accurately captures the complex cellular signaling, molecular and theoretical levels of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). As an example, our model simulated the optimal CHM formulas for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) with depression, and through model sensitivity analysis, we calculated the balanced scoring of the formulas. Furthermore, we constructed a biological knowledge graph representing interactions by associating herb-target and gene-disease interactions. Finally, we experimentally confirmed the therapeutic effect and pharmacological mechanism of a novel model-predicted intervention in humans and mice. This novel multiscale model opened up a new avenue to combine “disease syndrome” and “macro micro” system modeling to facilitate translational research in CHM formulas. © 2023 The Authors",,

Advancements in medical technology present an opportunity to leverage these observations to improve patient diagnosis and care. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) model for AD detection using electrocardiograms (ECGs) and introduce the AI-Aortic-Dissection-ECG (AADE) score to provide clinicians with a measure to determine AD severity. Methods: From a cohort of 1878 patients, including 313 with AD, and 313 with chest pain (control group), we created training and validation subsets (7:3 ratio). A convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was trained for AD detection, with performance metrics like accuracy and F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) monitored. The AI-derived AADE score (0–1) was investigated against clinical parameters and ECG features over a median follow-up of 21.2 months. Results: The CNN model demonstrated robust performance with an accuracy of 0.93 and an F1 score of 0.93 for the AD group, and an accuracy of 0.871 with an F1 score of 0.867 for the chest pain group. The AADE score showed correlations with specific ECG patterns and demonstrated that higher scores aligned with increased mortality risk. Conclusions: Our CNN-based AI model offers a promising approach for AD detection using ECG. The AADE score, based on AI, can serve as a pivotal tool in refining clinical assessments and management strategies. Copyright by the Author(s), 2024.",,

This study aimed to examine the risk factors of HF development after treatment by anticancer agents, using a machine learning-based analysis of a massive dataset obtained from the electronic health record (EHR) in Japan. This retrospective, cohort study, using a dataset from 2008 to 2017 in the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database in Japan, enrolled 140,327 patients. The structure of risk factors was determined using multivariable analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm for time-to-event data. The mean follow-up period was 1.55 years. The prevalence of HF after anticancer agent administration were 4.0%. HF was more prevalent in the older than the younger. As the presence of cardiovascular diseases and various risk factors predicted HF, CART analysis of the risk factors revealed that the risk factor structures complicatedly differed among different age groups. The highest risk combination was hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation in the group aged ≤ 64 years, and the presence of ischemic heart disease was a key in both groups aged 65–74 years and 75 ≤ years. The machine learning-based approach was able to develop complicated HF risk structures in cancer patients after anticancer agents in different age population, of which knowledge would be essential for realizing precision medicine to improve the prognosis of cancer patients. © 2023, The Author(s).",,

Many patients require intensive care due to severe COVID-19. Remdesivir, a key treatment option among viral RNA polymerase inhibitors, lacks comprehensive studies on factors associated with its effectiveness. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in 2022, analyzing data from 252 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with remdesivir. Six machine learning algorithms were compared to predict factors influencing remdesivir’s clinical benefits regarding mortality and hospital stay. Results: The extreme gradient boost (XGB) method showed the highest accuracy for both mortality (95.45%) and hospital stay (94.24%). Factors associated with worse outcomes in terms of mortality included limitations in life support, ventilatory support needs, lymphopenia, low albumin and hemoglobin levels, flu and/or coinfection, and cough. For hospital stay, factors included vaccine doses, lung density, pulmonary radiological status, comorbidities, oxygen therapy, troponin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and asthenia.

However, traditional tools such as the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) may underperform within the diverse intermediate-risk group, which includes individuals requiring distinct management strategies. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a lipidomic-enhanced risk score (LRS), specifically targeting risk prediction and reclassification within the intermediate group, benchmarked against the FRS. Methods: The LRS was developed via a machine learning workflow using ridge regression on the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab; n = 10,339). It was externally validated with the Busselton Health Study (n = 4,492), and its predictive utility for coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS)–based outcomes was independently validated in the BioHEART cohort (n = 994). Results: LRS significantly improved discrimination metrics for the intermediate-risk group in both AusDiab and Busselton Health Study cohorts (all P < 0.001), increasing the area under the curve for CVD events by 0.114 (95% CI: 0.1123-0.1157) and 0.077 (95% CI: 0.0755-0.0785), with a net reclassification improvement of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.21-0.51) and 0.33 (95% CI: 0.15-0.49), respectively. For CACS-based outcomes in BioHEART, LRS achieved a significant area under the curve improvement of 0.02 over the FRS (0.76 vs 0.74; P < 1.0 × 10-5). A simplified, clinically applicable version of LRS was also created that had comparable performance to the original LRS. Conclusions: LRS, augmenting the FRS, presents potential to improve intermediate-risk stratification and to predict atherosclerotic markers using a simple blood test, suitable for clinical application. This could facilitate the triage of individuals for noninvasive imaging such as CACS, fostering precision medicine in CVD prevention and management. © 2024 The Authors",,

However, its non-transparency limited result interpretations and clinical usability. To improve the transparency of our previous approach with minimal compromise to the maximal statin treatment benefit-to-risk ratio, this study proposed a five-step pipeline approach called the decision rules for statin treatment (DRST). Steps 1–3 of our proposed pipeline improved our previous PSTP model in optimizing individual benefit-to-risk ratio; Step 4 used a decision tree model (DRST) to provide straightforward rules in the initial statin treatment plan; Step 5 aimed to evaluate the efficacy of these decision rules by conducting a clinical trial simulation. We included 107,739 de-identified patient data from Optum Labs Database Warehouse in this study. The final decision rules were compact and efficient, resulting from a decision tree with only a maximum depth of 3 and 11 nodes. The DRST identified three factors that are easily obtainable at the point of care: age, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and age-adjusted Charlson score. Moreover, it also identified six subpopulations that can benefit most from these decision rules. In our clinical trial simulations, DRST was found to improve statin benefit in LDL-C reduction by 4.15 percentage points (pp) and reduce risks of statin-associated symptoms (SAS) and statin discontinuation by 11.71 and 3.96 pp, respectively, when compared to the standard of care. Moreover, these DRST results were only less than 0.6 pp suboptimal to PSTP, demonstrating that building DRST that provide transparency with minimal compromise to the maximal benefit-to-risk ratio of statin treatments is feasible. © 2024 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.",,

However, many patients fail to achieve the guide-recommended goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after statin monotherapy, leading to a high residual risk of cardiovascular events. Owing to individual differences in statin therapy, it is possible first to consider changing the type of statin before adding nonstatin medications in certain patients to improve LDL-C management. We developed and evaluated a statin recommendation system using real-world data. Ensemble learning was performed to develop the recommendation system that integrated the output results of support vector machines (SVM) and the similarity of patients. Model performance was assessed to investigate whether treatment according to the recommended model would increase the proportion of patients with the primary end point. Finally, a total of 3510 patients were enrolled in the development and validation of the recommender system. Of them, 1240 patients received atorvastatin (35.3%), 1714 patients received rosuvastatin (48.8%), and 556 patients received pitavastatin (15.8%).

Based on the causal forest (CF) method, we developed an iterative CF (iCF) algorithm to identify HTEs in subgroups defined by important variables. Our method iteratively grows different depths of the CF with important effect modifiers, performs plurality votes to obtain decision trees (subgroup decisions) for a family of CFs with different depths, and then finds the cross-validated subgroup decision that best predicts the treatment effect as a final subgroup decision. We simulated 12 different scenarios and showed that the iCF outperformed other machine learning methods for interaction/subgroup identification in the majority of scenarios assessed. Using a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, we implemented the iCF to identify subgroups with HTEs for hospitalized heart failure. Consistent with previous studies suggesting patients with heart failure benefit more from sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, iCF successfully identified such a subpopulation with HTEs and additive interactions. The iCF is a promising method for identifying subgroups with HTEs in real-world data where the potential for unmeasured confounding can be limited by study design.  © 2023 The Author(s).",,

Leveraging AI for dynamic prediction has the potential to revolutionize risk stratification and provide personalized decision support for DAPT management. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and validated a new AI-based pipeline using retrospective data of drug-eluting stent-treated patients, sourced from the Cerner Health Facts data set (n=98 236) and Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (n=9978). The 36 months following drug-eluting stent implantation were designated as our primary forecasting interval, further segmented into 6 sequential prediction windows. We evaluated 5 distinct AI algorithms for their precision in predicting ischemic and bleeding risks. Model discriminative accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among other metrics. The weighted light gradient boosting machine stood out as the preeminent model, thus earning its place as our AI-DAPT model. The AI-DAPT demonstrated peak accuracy in the 30 to 36 months window, charting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90% [95% CI, 88%–92%] for ischemia and 84% [95% CI, 82%–87%] for bleeding predictions. CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-DAPT excels in formulating iterative, refined dynamic predictions by assimilating ongoing updates from patients’ clinical profiles, holding value as a novel smart clinical tool to facilitate optimal DAPT duration management with high accuracy and adaptability. © 2024 The Authors.",,

New tools are needed to improve precision of treatment by optimizing the balance between efficacy, safety, and cost. We developed a high-throughput multi-marker decision support instrument which simultaneously quantifies proteins associated with CVD. Methods and findings Candidate proteins independently associated with different clinical outcomes were selected from clinical studies by the screening of 368 circulating biomarkers. We then custom-designed a quantitative PEA-panel with 21 proteins (CVD-21) by including recombinant antigens as calibrator samples for normalization and absolute quantification of the proteins. The utility of the CVD-21 tool was evaluated in plasma samples from a case-control cohort of 4224 patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) using multivariable Cox regression analyses and machine learning techniques. The assays in the CVD-21 tool gave good precision and high sensitivity with lower level of determination (LOD) between 0.03–0.7 pg/ml for five of the biomarkers. The dynamic range for the assays was sufficient to accurately quantify the biomarkers in the validation study except for troponin I, which in the modeling was replaced by high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-TnT). We created seven different multimarker models, including a reference model with NT-proBNP, hs-TnT, GDF-15, IL-6, and cystatin C and one model with only clinical variables, for the comparison of the discriminative value of the CVD-21 tool. All models with biomarkers including hs-TnT provided similar discrimination for all outcomes, e.g. c-index between 0.68–0.86 and outperformed models using only clinical variables. Most important prognostic biomarkers were MMP-12, U-PAR, REN, VEGF-D, FGF-23, TFF3, ADM, and SCF. Conclusions The CVD-21 tool is the very first instrument which with PEA simultaneously quantifies 21 proteins with associations to different CVD. Novel pathophysiologic and prognostic information beyond that of established biomarkers were identified by a number of proteins. Copyright: © 2023 Siegbahn et al.

Hence, symptomatic diagnosis is inadequate to explain the underlying molecular-genetic abnormality and individual genomic disparities. The current trends include molecular-genetic information relying on algorithms to recognize the disease subtypes through gene expressions. Despite their disposition toward disease-specific heterogeneity and cross-disease homogeneity, a gap still exists in describing the extent of homogeneity within the heterogeneous subpopulation of different diseases. They are limited to obtaining the holistic sense of the whole genome-based diagnosis resulting in inaccurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Addressing those ambiguities, our proposed framework, ReDisX, introduces a unique classification system for the patients based on their genomic signatures. In this study, it is a scalable machine learning algorithm deployed to re-categorize the patients with rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease. It reveals heterogeneous subpopulations within a disease and homogenous subpopulations across different diseases. Besides, it identifies granzyme B (GZMB) as a subpopulation-differentiation marker that plausibly serves as a prominent indicator for GZMB-targeted drug repurposing. The ReDisX framework offers a novel strategy to redefine disease diagnosis through characterizing personalized genomic signatures.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a global public health concern, accounting for nearly 18 million deaths annually. Timely diagnosis and intervention are paramount for improving CVD outcomes. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for CVD prediction, but existing ML models often struggle with accuracy and interpretability. This study proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep belief networks (DBN-Nets), transfer learning, and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) for CVD prediction. The proposed framework initially leverages CNNs to extract high-level features from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Subsequently, DBN-Nets are employed to learn a hierarchical representation of the extracted features, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. To further augment the model's performance, transfer learning is implemented by fine-tuning a pre-trained DBN-Net on the CVD prediction task. Finally, DES is utilized to select the most informative features, reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving the model's interpretability. Experimental results on a benchmark ECG dataset (PhysioNet ECG Database) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.This study contributes to the ongoing pursuit of precision medicine and proactive disease management, which enhances survival of many patients with advance prescription alerting. © 2024, Ismail Saritas.

One of the multiple origins of HTG alteration is impaired lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which is an emerging target for HTG treatment. We hypothesised that early, even mild, alterations in LPL activity might result in an identifiable metabolomic signature. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a metabolic signature of altered LPL activity in a preclinical model can be identified in humans. A preclinical LPL-dependent model of HTG was developed using a single intraperitoneal injection of poloxamer 407 (P407) in male Wistar rats. A rat metabolomics signature was identified, which led to a predictive model developed using machine learning techniques. The predictive model was applied to 140 humans classified according to clinical guidelines as (1) normal, less than 1.7 mmol/L; (2) risk of HTG, above 1.7 mmol/L. Injection of P407 in rats induced HTG by effectively inhibiting plasma LPL activity. Significantly responsive metabolites (i.e. specific triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol esters and lysophospholipids) were used to generate a predictive model. Healthy human volunteers with the impaired predictive LPL signature had statistically higher levels of TG, TC, LDL and APOB than those without the impaired LPL signature. The application of predictive metabolomic models based on mechanistic preclinical research may be considered as a strategy to stratify subjects with HTG of different origins. This approach may be of interest for precision medicine and nutritional approaches. © 2023, The Author(s).",,

Advances in CT scanner technology and developments of analytic tools now enable accurate quantification of coronary artery disease (CAD), including total coronary plaque volume and low attenuation plaque volume. The primary aim of CONFIRM2, (Quantitative COroNary CT Angiography Evaluation For Evaluation of Clinical Outcomes: An InteRnational, Multicenter Registry) is to perform comprehensive quantification of CCTA findings, including coronary, non-coronary cardiac, non-cardiac vascular, non-cardiac findings, and relate them to clinical variables and cardiovascular clinical outcomes. Design: CONFIRM2 is a multicenter, international observational cohort study designed to evaluate multidimensional associations between quantitative phenotype of cardiovascular disease and future adverse clinical outcomes in subjects undergoing clinically indicated CCTA. The targeted population is heterogenous and includes patients undergoing CCTA for atherosclerotic evaluation, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease or pre-procedural evaluation. Automated software will be utilized for quantification of coronary plaque, stenosis, vascular morphology and cardiac structures for rapid and reproducible tissue characterization. Up to 30,000 patients will be included from up to 50 international multi-continental clinical CCTA sites and followed for 3–4 years.

Early detection and effective risk assessment are crucial for implementing preventive measures and improving patient outcomes for CVDs. This work presents a novel approach to CVD risk assessment using fundus images, leveraging the inherent connection between retinal microvascular changes and systemic vascular health. This study aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection of CVDs by evaluating retinal vascular parameters. This methodology integrates both handcrafted features derived through mathematical computation and retinal vascular patterns extracted by artificial intelligence (AI) models. By combining these approaches, we seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of CVD risk prediction in individuals. The methodology integrates state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and AI techniques in a multi-stage architecture to extract relevant features from retinal fundus images. These features encompass a range of vascular parameters, including vessel caliber, tortuosity, and branching patterns. Additionally, a deep learning (DL)-based binary classification model is incorporated to enhance predictive accuracy. A dataset comprising fundus images and comprehensive metadata from the clinical trials conducted is utilized for training and validation. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results in the early prediction of CVD risk factors. The interpretability of the approach is enhanced through visualization techniques that highlight the regions of interest within the fundus images that are contributing to the risk predictions. Furthermore, the validation conducted in the clinical trials and the performance analysis of the proposed approach shows the potential to provide early and accurate predictions. The proposed system not only aids in risk stratification but also serves as a valuable tool for identifying vascular abnormalities that may precede overt cardiovascular events. The approach has achieved an accuracy of 85% and the findings of this study underscore the feasibility and efficacy of leveraging fundus images for cardiovascular risk assessment. As a non-invasive and cost-effective modality, fundus image analysis presents a scalable solution for population-wide screening programs. This research contributes to the evolving landscape of precision medicine by providing an innovative tool for proactive cardiovascular health management. Future work will focus on refining the solution’s robustness, exploring additional risk factors, and validating its performance in additional and diverse clinical settings. © 2024 by the authors.",,

Although it is widely recognized that CV risk assessment represents an essential prerequisite for clinical management, existing prognostic models appear not to be entirely adequate for CKD patients. We derived a literature-based, naïve-bayes model predicting the yearly risk of CV hospitalizations among patients suffering from CKD, referred as the CArdiovascular, LIterature-Based, Risk Algorithm (CALIBRA). Methods: CALIBRA incorporates 31 variables including traditional and CKD-specific risk factors. It was validated in two independent CKD populations: the FMC NephroCare cohort (European Clinical Database, EuCliD®) and the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study prospective cohort. CALIBRA performance was evaluated by c-statistics and calibration charts. In addition, CALIBRA discrimination was compared with that of three validated tools currently used for CV prediction in CKD, namely the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) risk score, the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score (ASCVD), and the Individual Data Analysis of Antihypertensive Intervention Trials (INDANA) calculator. Superiority was defined as a ΔAUC>0.05. Results: CALIBRA showed good discrimination in both the EuCliD® medical registry (AUC 0.79, 95%CI 0.76-0.81) and the GCKD cohort (AUC 0.73, 95%CI 0.70-0.76). CALIBRA demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the benchmark models in EuCliD® (FHS: ΔAUC=-0.22, p<0.001; ASCVD: ΔAUC=-0.17, p<0.001; INDANA: ΔAUC=-0.14, p<0.001) and GCKD (FHS: ΔAUC=-0.16, p<0.001; ASCVD: ΔAUC=-0.12, p<0.001; INDANA: ΔAUC=-0.04, p<0.001) populations. Accuracy of the CALIBRA score was stable also for patients showing missing variables. Conclusion: CALIBRA provides accurate and robust stratification of CKD patients according to CV risk and allows score calculations with improved accuracy compared to established CV risk scores also in real-world clinical cohorts with considerable missingness rates. Our results support the generalizability of CALIBRA across different CKD populations and clinical settings.

Cardiovascular toxicity can span the course of cancer treatment and is influenced by several factors. To mitigate these risks, cardio-oncology has evolved, with an emphasis on prevention and treatment of cardiovascular complications resulting from the presence of cancer and cancer therapy. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds multifaceted potential to enhance cardio-oncologic outcomes. AI algorithms are currently utilizing clinical data input to identify patients at risk for cardiac complications. Additional application opportunities for AI in cardio-oncology involve multimodal cardiovascular imaging, where algorithms can also utilize imaging input to generate predictive risk profiles for cancer patients. The impact of AI extends to digital health tools, playing a pivotal role in the development of digital platforms and wearable technologies. Multidisciplinary teams have been formed to implement and evaluate the efficacy of these technologies, assessing AI-driven clinical decision support tools. Other avenues similarly support practical application of AI in clinical practice, such as incorporation into electronic health records (EHRs) to detect patients at risk for cardiovascular diseases. While these AI applications may help improve preventive measures and facilitate tailored treatment to patients, they are also capable of perpetuating and exacerbating healthcare disparities, if trained on limited, homogenous datasets. However, if trained and operated appropriately, AI holds substantial promise in positively influencing clinical practice in cardio-oncology. In this review, we explore the impact of AI on cardio-oncology care, particularly regarding predicting cardiotoxicity from cancer treatments, while addressing racial and ethnic biases in algorithmic implementation. © 2024 The Author(s)",,

Affecting approximately 25% of the global population, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver condition, with higher prevalence among those with obesity. This letter stresses the importance of early diagnosis and intervention, especially given the rising incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Research advancements provide insight into the potential of biomarkers (particularly inflammation-related) as predictive tools for disease progression and treatment response. This overview addresses pleiotropic biomarkers linked to chronic inflammation and cardiometabolic disorders, which may aid in risk stratification and treatment efficacy monitoring. Despite progress, significant knowledge gaps remain in the clinical application of these biomarkers, necessitating further research to establish standardized protocols and validate their utility in clinical practice. Understanding the complex interactions among these factors opens new avenues to enhance risk assessment, leading to better patient outcomes and addressing the public health burden of this worldwide condition. ©The Author(s) 2024.",,

The early risk assessment system based on a variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms may be able to provide more accurate advice on the classification of COVID-19 patients, offering predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) solutions in the future. Methods: In this retrospective study, we divided a portion of the data into training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio and established a model based on a combination of two ML algorithms first. Then, we used another portion of the data as an independent testing cohort to determine the most accurate and stable model and compared it with other scoring systems. Finally, patients were categorized according to risk scores and then the correlation between their clinical data and risk scores was studied. Results: The elderly accounted for the majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The C-index of the model constructed by combining the stepcox[both] and survivalSVM algorithms was 0.840 in the training cohort and 0.815 in the validation cohort, which was calculated to have the highest C-index in the testing cohort compared to the other 119 ML model combinations. Compared with current scoring systems, including the CURB-65 and several reported prognosis models previously, our model had the highest AUC value of 0.778, representing an even higher predictive performance. In addition, the model’s AUC values for specific time intervals, including days 7,14 and 28, demonstrate excellent predictive performance. Most importantly, we stratified patients according to the model’s risk score and demonstrated a difference in survival status between the high-risk, median-risk, and low-risk groups, which means a new and stable risk assessment system was built. Finally, we found that COVID-19 patients with a history of cerebral infarction had a significantly higher risk of death. Conclusion: This novel risk assessment system is highly accurate in predicting the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, especially elderly patients with COVID-19, and can be well applied within the PPPM framework. Our ML model facilitates stratified patient management, meanwhile promoting the optimal use of healthcare resources. Copyright © 2024 Qin, Li, Zhu, Yu, Peng, Wu, Xu, Gu and Guo.",,

Methods: From March 2021 to May 2023, 82 participants with breast cancer treated with anthracyclines with/without trastuzumab were prospectively recruited. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months in relation to baseline. T1ρ, T1 and T2 values were measured and compared by repeated measures analyses of variance. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to assess the performance in predicting subsequent CTRCD. Results: Nineteen (23.17 %) participants developed CTRCD. T1ρ and T1 values progressively increased over time (all p < 0.001), while T2 values increased at 3 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively) and 6 months (all p < 0.001) compared to baseline in both the CTRCD (+) and CTRCD (−) groups.

Critical lower extremity ischemia may require amputation, and the outcomes vary. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive model for PAD subtypes to assess risk among patients more precisely and accurately to predict disease progression. Methods: The present retrospective study examined clinical data in PAD patents undergoing lower extremity amputation. The data were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (UMLA) for subgroup identification and risk stratification. The clustering result accuracy was validated by analyzing the follow-up data of clusters. Finally, we built the prediction model with binary logistic regression. Results: In total, we enrolled 507 cases into this work. Two distinct subgroups, consisting of Clusters 1 and 2, were identified by UMLA; those from Cluster 1 showed markedly poorer conditions and prognostic outcomes compared with those from Cluster 2. With regard to the new PAD subtype, we established a nomogram with eight predictive factors, including gender, age, smoking history, diabetes and coronary heart disease history, albumin levels, endovascular intervention, and amputation level. The nomogram could accurately categorize patients into two identified clusters, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.861 (95 % confidence interval: 0.830–0.893). Conclusion: In this study, UMLA was used to identify new phenotypic subgroups among PAD cases who showed different risks of amputation. Our constructed AI-driven predictive model for PAD subtypes showed that it can be used for risk stratification and clinical management with high accuracy and reliability. © 2024 The Authors",,

Survivors of AMI are particularly at high risk for additional cardiovascular events. Consequently, a comprehensive approach to secondary prevention is necessary to mitigate the occurrence of downstream complications. This may be achieved through a multiparametric tailored risk stratification by incorporating clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters. Methods: The ‘‘CLEAR-AMI Study’’ (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05791916) is a non-interventional, prospective study including consecutive patients with AMI without a known history of coronary artery disease. All patients satisfying these inclusion criteria are enrolled in the present study. The rationale of this study is to refine risk stratification by using clinical, laboratory and novel echocardiographic biomarkers. All the patients undergo a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic assessment, including strain and myocardial work analysis of the left and right heart chambers, within 48 h of admission after coronary angiography. Their laboratory profile focusing on systemic inflammation is captured during the first 24 h upon admission, and their demographic characteristics, past medical history, and therapeutic management are recorded. The angioplasty details are documented, the non-culprit coronary lesions are archived, and the SYNTAX score is employed to evaluate the complexity of coronary artery disease. A 24-month follow-up period will be recorded for all patients recruited. Conclusion: The ‘‘CLEAR-AMI” study is an ongoing prospective registry endeavoring to refine risk assessment in patients with AMI without a known history of coronary artery disease, by incorporating echocardiographic parameters, biochemical indices, and clinical and coronary characteristics in the acute phase of AMI. © 2023 by the authors.",,

With the deepening research on miRNAs, more and more researches show that the abnormal expression of miRNAs is closely related to various diseases. The relationship between miRNAs and diseases is crucial for discovering the pathogenesis of diseases and exploring new treatment methods. Methods: Therefore, we propose a new sparse autoencoder and MLP method (SPALP) to predict the association between miRNAs and diseases. In this study, we adopt advanced deep learning technologies, including sparse autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to improve the accuracy of predicting miRNA-disease associations. Firstly, the SPALP model uses a sparse autoencoder to perform feature learning and extract the initial features of miRNAs and diseases separately, obtaining the latent features of miRNAs and diseases. Then, the latent features combine miRNAs functional similarity data with diseases semantic similarity data to construct comprehensive miRNAs-diseases datasets. Subsequently, the MLP model can predict the unknown association among miRNAs and diseases. Result: To verify the performance of our model, we set up several comparative experiments. The experimental results show that, compared with traditional methods and other deep learning prediction methods, our method has significantly improved the accuracy of predicting miRNAs-disease associations, with 94.61% accuracy and 0.9859 AUC value. Finally, we conducted case study of SPALP model.

This challenge is amplified in complex conditions like congenital heart disease due to disease variability and limited trial applicability. To address this, medicine-based evidence was proposed to synthesize information for personalized care. A recent article introduced a patient similarity network, CHDmap, which represents a promising technical rendition of the medicine-based evidence concept. Leveraging comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data, CHDmap creates an interactive patient map representing individuals with similar attributes. Using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, CHDmap interactively identifies closely resembling patient groups based on specific characteristics. These approximate matches form the foundation for predictive analyses, including outcomes like hospital length of stay and complications. A key finding is the tool’s dual capacity: not only did it corroborate clinical intuition in many scenarios, but in specific instances, it prompted a reevaluation of cases, culminating in an enhancement of overall performance across various classification tasks. While an important first step, future versions of CHDmap may aim to expand mapping complexity, increase data granularity, consider long-term outcomes, allow for treatment comparisons, and implement artificial intelligence–driven weighting of various input variables. Successful implementation of CHDmap and similar tools will require training for practitioners, robust data infrastructure, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Patient similarity networks may become valuable in multidisciplinary discussions, complementing clinicians’ expertise. The symbiotic approach bridges evidence, experience, and real-life care, enabling iterative learning for future physicians. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.",,

Additionally, the thesis investigates how these novel biomarkers can be integrated with digital health technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to enhance diagnostic accuracy and develop patient-specific treatment strategies. It also considers the role of these biomarkers in preventive cardiology, particularly in identifying individuals at risk before symptoms appear. The thesis concludes by emphasizing the importance of advanced diagnostic tools in early detection and monitoring of MI and HF, the promising future of personalized medicine in cardiovascular disease care, and suggests directions for future research. The overall aim is to contribute to improved patient outcomes and better management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) globally. © 2024, Dr. Yashwant Research Labs Pvt. Ltd.. All rights reserved.",,

This study examined how to make and compare different CVD prediction models using a large dataset that included biochemical, clinical, and demographic information about each person. During the preprocessing stage, we took great care to ensure the data’s accuracy and quality. We have utilized a variety of machine learning algorithms such as random forest, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning neural networks. We assessed the performance of these models using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Our findings show that while more sophisticated algorithms—especially deep learning models—perform better at spotting possible instances of CVD, more conventional models—such as regression—offer significant predictive power. We also investigated the role that feature selection has in improving the interpretability and efficiency of the model.

Diabetes, considered a high glucose level, requires continuous management to avoid complications like kidney failure, low vision, and heart disease. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, especially IoT devices, shows great potential for optimizing the recognition and management of diabetes. These devices, including smart glucose monitors and wearable sensors, provide real-time data on crucial health metrics, enabling early intervention and proactive monitoring. Furthermore, incorporating deep learning (DL) techniques improves data analysis and recognizes risk factors and subtle patterns related to diabetes. By integrating IoT technology with DL techniques, the healthcare system can empower patients with tools for self-management and develop more conventional approaches for earlier diagnosis and personalized treatment plans, ultimately improving long-term health outcomes and reducing the burden of diabetes. This study develops a new IoT-enabled Driven Early Detection of Chronic Disease using the DL and Dimensionality Reduction (EDCD-DLDR) approach. The EDCD-DLDR method aims to enable IoT devices to collect patient medical data and employ the DL model for earlier diagnosis of diabetes. In the EDCD-DLDR technique, the IoT-based data acquisition process is initially involved, and the collected data gets normalized using Z-score normalization. The EDCD-DLDR technique uses an artificial rabbit optimizer-based feature selection (ARO-FS) approach for dimensionality reduction. In addition, the detection of diabetes is achieved by the attention bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ABiGRU) model. The pelican optimization algorithm (POA) based hyperparameter selection model is included to improve the performance of the ABiGRU network. A comprehensive set of simulations is made to highlight the performance of the EDCD-DLDR method on the Kaggle dataset. The experimental validation of the EDCD-DLDR method underscored a superior accuracy value of 97.14% over existing techniques.  © 2013 IEEE.",,

Methods: The K-means clustering analysis was performed on two cohorts (n = 590 and 392), both consisting of Chinese participants with newly diagnosed T2D. To assess genetic risks, multiple polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and mitochondrial DNA copy numbers (mtDNA-CN) were calculated for all participants. Furthermore, Framingham risk scores (FRS) of cardiovascular diseases in two cohorts were also calculated to verify the genetic risks. Results: Four clusters were identified including the mild age-related diabetes (MARD)(35.08%), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) (34.41%), severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID) 19.15%, and severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD) 11.36% subgroups in the MARCH (metformin, and acarbose in Chinese patients as the initial hypoglycemic treatment) cohort. There was a significant difference in PRS for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) across four subgroups in the MARCH cohort (p < 0.05). Compared with the SIDD and SIRD subgroups, patients in the MOD subgroup had a relatively lower PRS for CVD (p < 0.05) in the MARCH cohort. Females had a higher PRS compared to males, with no significant difference in FRS across the four clusters. The MOD subgroup had a significantly lower FRS which was consistent with the results of PRS. Similar results of PRS and FRS were also replicated in the CONFIDENCE (comparison of glycemic control and b-cell function among newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes treated with exenatide, insulin or pioglitazone) cohort.

The accurate dose regimen is important to maximize effectiveness and minimize adverse reactions. We aim to explore the effect of Shengmai injection in patients with coronary heart disease based on real-world data and establish a personalized medicine model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Methods: 211 patients were enrolled. The length of hospital stay was used to explore the effect of Shengmai injection in a case-control study. We applied propensity score matching to reduce bias and Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare results between the experimental group and the control group. Important variables influencing the dose regimen of Shengmai injection were screened by XGBoost. A personalized medicine model of Shengmai injection was established by XGBoost selected from nine algorithm models. SHapley Additive exPlanations and confusion matrix were used to interpret the results clinically. Results: Patients using Shengmai injection had shorter length of hospital stay than those not using Shengmai injection (median 10.00 days vs. 11.00 days, p = 0.006). The personalized medicine model established via XGBoost shows accuracy = 0.81 and AUC = 0.87 in test cohort and accuracy = 0.84 and AUC = 0.84 in external verification. The important variables influencing the dose regimen of Shengmai injection include lipid-lowering drugs, platelet-lowering drugs, levels of GGT, hemoglobin, prealbumin, and cholesterol at admission. Finally, the personalized model shows precision = 75%, recall rate = 83% and F1-score = 79% for predicting 40 mg of Shengmai injection; and precision = 86%, recall rate = 79% and F1-score = 83% for predicting 60 mg of Shengmai injection.

Using data from four different sources, we evaluated the outcomes of three machine learning algorithms for CVE prediction using different combinations of predictive variables and analysed the influence of different CVRF-related variables on CVE prediction when included in these algorithms. A cohort study based on a male cohort of workers applying populational data was conducted. The population of the study consisted of 3746 males. For descriptive analyses, mean and standard deviation were used for quantitative variables, and percentages for categorical ones. Machine learning algorithms used were XGBoost, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes (NB). They were applied to two groups of variables: i) age, physical status, Hypercholesterolemia (HC), Hypertension, and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and ii) these variables plus treatment exposure, based on the adherence to the treatment for DM, hypertension and HC. All methods point out to the age as the most influential variable in the incidence of a CVE. When considering treatment exposure, it was more influential than any other CVRF, which changed its influence depending on the model and algorithm applied. According to the performance of the algorithms, the most accurate was Random Forest when treatment exposure was considered (F1 score 0.84), followed by XGBoost. Adherence to treatment showed to be an important variable in the risk of having a CVE.

A nested case-cohort study measured plasma levels of 2923 proteins using Olink Explore panel in ~ 4000 Chinese adults (1976 incident IHD cases and 2001 sub-cohort controls). We used conventional and machine learning (Boruta) methods to develop proteomics-based prediction models of IHD, with discrimination assessed using area under the curve (AUC), C-statistics and net reclassification index (NRI). These were compared with conventional risk factors and PS in Chinese and in 37,187 Europeans. Overall, 446 proteins were associated with IHD (false discovery rate < 0.05) in Chinese after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Proteomic risk models alone yielded higher C-statistics for IHD than conventional risk factors or PS (0.855 [95%CI 0.841–0.868] vs. 0.845 [0.829–0.860] vs 0.553 [0.528–0.578], respectively). Addition of 446 proteins to PS improved C-statistics to 0.857 (0.843–0.871) and NRI by 109.1%; and addition to conventional risk factors improved C-statistics to 0.868 (0.854–0.882) and NRI by 86.9%. Boruta analysis identified 30 proteins accounting for ~ 90% of improvement in NRI for IHD conferred by all 2923 proteins.

The study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict individual blood pressure (BP) responses to different antihypertensive medications. Methods and results: We used data from a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial on hypertension management in China. Each patient's multiple visit records were included, and two consecutive visits were paired as the index and subsequent visits. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to select index visit variables for predicting subsequent BP. The dataset was randomly divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and R-square in the test set. A total of 19,013 hypertension management visit records (6282 patients) were included. The mean age of the study population was 63.9 years, and 2657 (42.3%) were females. A total of 12 phenotypical features (age, sex, smoking within seven days, body mass index, waist circumference, index visit systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, comorbidities of diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and stroke), together with currently taking any prescribed antihypertensive medication regimens and visits time interval were selected to build the model. The Extreme Gradient Boost model performed best among all candidate algorithms, with an MAE of 8.57 mmHg and an R2 = 0.28 in the test set.

Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), the adipose tissue surrounding coronary arteries, has attracted increased amounts of attention. Developing a model for predicting the incidence of MACE utilizing machine learning (ML) integrating clinical and PVAT features may facilitate targeted preventive interventions and improve patient outcomes. Methods: From January 2017 to December 2019, we analyzed a cohort of 1077 individuals who underwent coronary CT scanning at our facility. Clinical features were collected alongside imaging features, such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) characteristics. Logistic regression (LR), Framingham Risk Score, and ML algorithms were employed for MACE prediction. Results: We screened seven critical features to improve the practicability of the model. MACE patients tended to be older, smokers, and hypertensive. Imaging biomarkers such as CAC scores and PVAT characteristics differed significantly between patients with and without a 3-year MACE risk in a population that did not exhibit disparities in laboratory results. The ensemble model, which leverages multiple ML algorithms, demonstrated superior predictive performance compared with the other models. Finally, the ensemble model was used for risk stratification prediction to explore its clinical application value. Conclusions: The developed ensemble model effectively predicted MACE incidence based on clinical and imaging features, highlighting the potential of ML algorithms in cardiovascular risk prediction and personalized medicine.

However, current symptom networks are constructed based on the average survivors without considering individual heterogeneities. We propose to evaluate personal symptom network estimation using the Ising model with covariates through simulations and estimate personal symptom network for adult childhood cancer survivors. Patients and Methods: We adopted the Ising model with covariates to construct networks by employing logistic regressions for estimating associations between binary symptoms. Simulation experiments assessed the robustness of this method in constructing personal symptom network. Real-world data illustration included 1708 adult childhood cancer survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (SJLIFE), a retrospective cohort study with prospective follow-up to characterize the etiology and late effects for childhood cancer survivors. Patients’ baseline symptoms in 10 domains (cardiac, pulmonary, sensation, nausea, movement, pain, memory, fatigue, anxiety, depression) and individual characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, attained education, personal income, and marital status) were self-reported using survey. Treatment variables (any chemo or radiation therapy) were obtained from medical records. Personal symptom network of 10 domains was estimated using the Ising model, incorporating individual characteristics and treatment data. Results: Simulations confirmed the robustness of the Ising model with covariates in constructing personal symptom networks. Real-world data analysis identified age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and treatment (any chemo and radiation therapy) as major factors influencing symptom co-occurrence. Older childhood cancer survivors showed stronger cardiac-fatigue associations. Survivors of racial/ethnic minorities had stronger pain-fatigue associations. Female survivors with above-college education demonstrated stronger pain-anxiety associations. Unmarried survivors who received radiation had stronger association between movement and memory problems. Conclusion: The Ising model with covariates accurately estimates personal symptom networks. Individual heterogeneities exist in symptom co-occurrence patterns for childhood cancer survivors. The estimated personal symptom network offers insights into interconnected symptom experiences. © 2024 Zhou et al.",,

Recent methodological advancements enable us to predict treatment effects at the individual level. Methods: We employed causal forest to explore the relationship between PRSs and individual risk of diseases associated with certain environmental factors. Following simulations illustrating its performance, we applied our approach to investigate the individual risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including coronary artery diseases (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), associated with obesity and smoking among individuals from UK Biobank (UKB; n = 369,942) and BioBank Japan (BBJ; n = 149,421). Results: Here we find the heterogeneous association of obesity and smoking with diseases across PRS values, complicated by the multi-dimensional combination of individual characteristics such as age and sex. The highest positive correlations of PRSs and the exposure-related disease risks are observed between obesity and T2D in UKB and between smoking and CAD in BBJ (Spearman’s ρ = 0.61 and 0.32, respectively). However, most relationships are weak or negative, suggesting that high-PRS groups will not necessarily benefit most from environmental factor prevention. Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of individual-level prediction of disease risks associated with target exposure in precision medicine. © The Author(s) 2024.",,

Rapid and precise prognostication of AIS is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study explores the integration of machine learning-derived radiomics signatures from multi-parametric MRI with clinical factors to forecast AIS prognosis. Objective: To develop and validate a nomogram that combines a multi-MRI radiomics signature with clinical factors for predicting the prognosis of AIS. Methods: This retrospective study involved 506 AIS patients from two centers, divided into training (n = 277) and validation (n = 229) cohorts. 4,682 radiomic features were extracted from T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Logistic regression analysis identified significant clinical risk factors, which, alongside radiomics features, were used to construct a predictive clinical-radiomics nomogram. The model’s predictive accuracy was evaluated using calibration and ROC curves, focusing on distinguishing between favorable (mRS ≤ 2) and unfavorable (mRS > 2) outcomes. Results: Key findings highlight coronary heart disease, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, uric acid, glucose levels, homocysteine, and radiomics features as independent predictors of AIS outcomes. The clinical-radiomics model achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.940 (95% CI: 0.912–0.969) in the training set and 0.854 (95% CI: 0.781–0.926) in the validation set, underscoring its predictive reliability and clinical utility. Conclusion: The study underscores the efficacy of the clinical-radiomics model in forecasting AIS prognosis, showcasing the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in fostering personalized treatment plans and enhancing patient care. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize AIS management, offering a significant leap toward more individualized and effective healthcare solutions.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a machine learning model to predict opti-mal DAPT duration after contemporary drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The One-Month DAPT, RESET (Real Safety and Efficacy of 3-Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Following Endeavor Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation), and IVUS-XPL (Impact of Intravascular Ultrasound Guidance on Outcomes of Xience Prime Stents in Long Lesion) trials provided a derivation cohort (n=6568). Using the X-learner ap-proach, an individualized DAPT score was developed to determine the therapeutic benefit of abbreviated (1–6 months) versus standard (12-month) DAPT using various predictors. The primary outcome was major bleeding; the secondary outcomes included 1-year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and 1-year net adverse clinical events. The risk reduction with abbreviated DAPT (3 months) in the individualized DAPT–determined higher predicted benefit group was validated in the TICO (Ticagrelor Monotherapy After 3 Months in the Patients Treated With New Generation Sirolimus-Eluting Stent for Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial (n=3056), which enrolled patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with ticagrelor. The validation cohort comprised 1527 abbreviated and 1529 standard DAPT cases. Major bleeding occurred in 25 (1.7%) and 45 (3.0%) patients in the abbreviated and standard DAPT groups, respectively. The individualized DAPT score identified 2582 (84.5%) participants who would benefit from abbreviated DAPT, which was significantly associated with a lower major bleeding risk (absolute risk difference [ARD], 1.26 [95% CI, 0.15–2.36]) and net adverse clinical events (ARD, 1.59 [95% CI, 0.07–3.10]) but not major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (ARD, 0.63 [95% CI, −0.34 to 1.61]), compared with standard DAPT in the higher predicted benefit group. Abbreviated DAPT had no significant difference in clinical outcomes of major bleeding (ARD, 1.49 [95% CI, −1.74 to 4.72]), net adverse clinical events (ARD, 2.57 [95% CI, −1.85 to 6.99]), or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (ARD, 1.54 [95% CI, −1.26 to 4.34]), compared with standard DAPT in the individualized DAPT– determined lower predicted benefit group.

METHODS AND RESULTS: CHD was defined in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) as myocardial infarction (251 participants), resuscitated arrest (2 participants), and CHD death (80 participants). We analyzed sequencing reads from 4421 MESA participants in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program using the PathSeq workflow of the Genome Analysis Tool Kit and a 65-gigabase microbial reference. Paired reads aligning to 840 microbes were detected in >1% of participants. The association of the presence of microbe reads with incident CHD (follow-up, ~18 years) was examined. First, important variables were ascertained using a single regularized Cox proportional hazard model, examining change of risk as a function of presence of microbe with age, sex, education level, Life’s Simple 7, and inflammation. For variables of importance, the hazard ratio (HR) was estimated in separate (unregularized) Cox proportional hazard models including the same covariates (significance threshold Bonferroni corrected P<6×10−5, 0.05/840). Reads from 2 microbes were significantly associated with CHD: Gemella morbillorum (HR, 3.14 [95% CI, 1.92–5.12]; P=4.86×10−6) and Pseudomonas species NFACC19-2 (HR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.03–5.41]; P=1.58×10−6). CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomics of whole-genome sequence reads opens a possible frontier for detection of pathogens for chronic diseases. The association of G morbillorum and Pseudomonas species reads with CHD raises the possibilities that microbes may drive atherosclerotic inflammation and that treatments for specific pathogens may provide clinical utility for CHD reduction. © 2024 The Author(s).",,

Here, we introduce a groundbreaking portable wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system designed to monitor glucose levels by assessing prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. Our study delineates the development and application of this novel fNIRS system, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize diabetes management by providing a non-invasive, real-time monitoring solution. Fifteen healthy university students participated in a controlled study, where we monitored their PFC activity and blood glucose levels under fasting and glucose-loaded conditions. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between PFC activity, as measured by our fNIRS system, and blood glucose levels, suggesting the feasibility of fNIRS technology for CGM. The portable nature of our system overcomes the mobility limitations of traditional setups, enabling continuous, real-time monitoring in everyday settings. We identified 10 critical features related to blood glucose levels from extensive fNIRS data and successfully correlated PFC function with blood glucose levels by constructing predictive models. Results show a positive association between fNIRS data and blood glucose levels, with the PFC exhibiting a clear response to blood glucose. Furthermore, the improved regressive rule principal component analysis (PCA) method outperforms traditional PCA in model prediction. We propose a model validation approach based on leave-one-out cross-validation, demonstrating the unique advantages of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. Comparative analysis with existing CGM methods reveals that our paper’s KNN model exhibits lower RMSE and MARD at 0.11 and 8.96%, respectively, and the fNIRS data were highly significant positive correlation with actual blood glucose levels (r = 0.995, p < 0.000). This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between metabolic states and brain activity, laying the foundation for innovative CGM solutions.

Conceivably, newly developed precision epigenetic technologies could drive down these costs. However, at the current time, their impact on overall expense for CHD care is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the use of a newly developed, highly sensitive, and specific epigenetic test, PrecisionCHD, could decrease the costs of secondary prevention. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we constructed a budget impact analysis using a cost calculation model that examined the effects of substituting PrecisionCHD for conventional CHD diagnostic tests on the expenses of the initial evaluation and first year of care of stable CHD using a 1-year time horizon with no discounting. Results: The model projected that for a commercial insurer with one million members, full adoption of PrecisionCHD as the primary method of initial CHD assessment would save approximately $113.6 million dollars in the initial year. Conclusion: These analyses support the use of precision epigenetic methods as part of the initial diagnosis and care of stable CHD and can meaningfully reduce cost.

Early detection in young adults is crucial for preventing adverse cardiovascular events. This study investigates the associations between inflammatory indices, lipid biomarkers, and the presence of atherosclerosis in patients aged 18 to 55 years. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 89 participants divided into two groups: 62 patients with documented atherosclerosis (main group) and 27 healthy controls without significant atherosclerosis. Comprehensive data—including demographic information, medication use, imaging results, laboratory parameters, and calculated inflammatory indices (SIRI, SII, AISI, NLR, PLR, MLR)—were collected. Statistical analyses included correlation assessments, group comparisons using the Mann–Whitney U test, logistic regression modeling, feature importance analysis with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and K-means clustering. Results: Significant differences were observed between the main and control groups. Patients with atherosclerosis exhibited elevated inflammatory indices (SIRI, NLR, MLR, SII) and lipid profile abnormalities (higher TC and LDL-C, lower HDL-C). Lp(a) and ANGPTL3 levels were significantly higher in the main group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Logistic regression identified SIRI and ANGPTL3 as significant predictors of atherosclerosis, with the model demonstrating high accuracy (77%) and sensitivity (93%). Feature importance analysis confirmed the significance of SIRI and ANGPTL3, alongside traditional lipid biomarkers, in predicting disease presence. ROC analysis showed excellent model performance (AUC > 0.80). Clustering analysis revealed two distinct patient subgroups characterized by predominant inflammatory profiles or lipid metabolism disturbances. Conclusions: Systemic inflammation and lipid abnormalities play significant roles in early atherosclerosis among young adults. Elevated SIRI and ANGPTL3 levels are potent predictors of disease presence.
